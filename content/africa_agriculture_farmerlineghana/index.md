Executive Summary 
==================

Farmerline is a private company that offers technology-driven solutions
to small-scale farmers. With offices in Ghana, Switzerland, and the
United States, Farmerline provides affordable services to farmers
seeking information on how to better access markets and prices,
efficacious cultivation practices, sustainable growth, and increased
productivity. In Ghana, where half the population depends on
agricultural production for their livelihood and many struggle,
Farmerline sells affordable mobile technology aimed at improving those
livelihoods into profitable and sustainable practices.

Context
=======

Agriculture has declined steadily as a major economic sector in Ghana;
in 1960, it contributed to 45.2 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP), but reduced to only 19.6 percent in 2016, according to a World
Bank report. Yet, about 45 percent of Ghana's labor force is still
engaged in agriculture, according to the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO). Low income and employment prospects in
rural areas drive the government to prioritize agriculture development
to generate more employment opportunities, in addition to ensuring food
security and nutrition balance. There are many barriers that hinder
Ghanaian farmers from accessing agricultural information to boost
productivity, including low literacy rates, lack of technology devices,
and nation-wide information and communications technology (ICT)
infrastructure, and various local languages. These challenges urge the
government and other agencies to find the effective methods to bring new
knowledge and information to all farmers.

The Ghana Agricultural Information Network (GAINS) has spearheaded a
live, one-hour-long radio show that broadcasts agriculture information
and features a question and answer session in partnership with numerous
local radio stations since 2004. Thousands of farmers have benefited
from these radio programs. In 2013, the Food Africa's partner IFPRI
collaborated with a local network operator called Esoko to provide
agricultural market information such as customized crop price
information to sample households twice a week via Short Message Service
(SMS) messages. Additionally, the Ghanaian government has strived to
provide more information to farmers through the E-agriculture Resources
website, toll free call center, and a WhatsApp number. Although these
efforts are significant, the population of farmers who do not have
access to radio, mobile phone devices, or computers will still have
difficulty in utilizing the information.

Project Description
===================

In 2014-2015, Farmerline conducted a FIRE-funded pilot project bringing
telephonic agricultural aid to fish farmers in the Ashanti and Brong
Ahafo regions of Ghana. The service consisted of free pre-recorded voice
messages sent to farmers' mobile phones, directed at strategic times
during fish cultivation cycles. The participating 3,000 farmers were
regular mobile telephone users, relying on voice communication due to
illiteracy. The messages were recorded in the region's local language
and contained information about weather, market prices, instructions,
facts, and tips to help farmers increase productivity and decrease
waste. These farmers had already participated in workshops in which
Farmerline researchers and agricultural experts assessed their needs and
values. The information provided is helping farmers increase fish
production, improve the sustainability of their practice, get better
prices at market, and increase their incomes.

The service is now operating with an affordable fee-based business model
and currently subscribes 225,000 farmers working on a diverse range of
farms. Farmerline's goal is to subscribe 1 million farmers by 2020.

Progress and Results
====================

Many of the participating fish farmers were inexperienced and untrained.
Their cultivation practices were resulting in low yield and high waste.
With Farmerline's recorded information coming at strategic and regular
interims, farmers were able to improve their knowledge of proper pond
density, feeding amounts and intervals, and cycles of fish production
and produce. They were thus able to grow bigger, better quality fish in
shorter amounts of time. Participating farmers were able to reduce costs
and increase income, with their fish prices at market increasing by 44
percent.

Farmerline is able to track if farmers listen to their messages and for
how long. This data shows places and moments in which network quality is
poor and farmers are not able to successfully access their messages.
Farmerline uses this data to adjust its timing for these areas in order
to optimize times in which network quality is suitable.

Challenges
==========

**Insufficient data** -- Fish farming heavily relies on feed quality and
water quality, which is very hard for farmers to measure. Fish quality
can vary according to water temperatures and pH levels, which differ
pond-by-pond and region-by-region. Farmerline is currently working with
local agricultural offices to develop methods to implement devices that
would communicate this information from the pond to the farmer and/or
local centers.

Farmerline's Suggestions for Future Projects
============================================

**Training is essential for building and maintaining trust ­--** The
training provided by Farmerline serves mostly to build trust between
farmers and the business people and experts providing them with
information. This trust aids not only in maintaining and increasing
subscription levels, but also in the confidence with which the farmers
implement Farmerline's advice, allowing for maximum impact.

**Understanding local user needs is essential while tailoring products
--** Education rates in these regions that Farmerline serves are very
low, making access to information technology difficult for those who
cannot read and/or whose language skills are restricted to local
dialects. Farmerline scrapped its early plans to deliver this service
via SMS for this reason and instead focuses on curating and timing their
information services in local languages, simple structures, frequent
intervals, affordably, and by voice.
