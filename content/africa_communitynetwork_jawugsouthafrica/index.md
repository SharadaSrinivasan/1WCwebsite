Executive Summary 
==================

Johannesburg Wireless User Group began as hobby-turned-university
project by four individuals in 2001. It had hundreds of participants at
the height of its popularity, although its numbers have dwindled. JAWUG
uses widely available standards-based radio frequency technology on a
license-free frequency. It aims to create a community-owned wireless
network. Free-to-use by non-members, JAWUG has a voluntary membership
fee used to defray some of its operational costs. By 2017, JAWUG saw its
user base dwindle to about 15 people, with a core group of eight who
work to maintain the network's functioning. JAWUG is an example of a
membership-model community wireless network sustained long-term by
dedicated enthusiasts, but has seen membership decline as Internet
access became more ubiquitous and cheaper from commercial providers.

Context
============

Johannesburg, the biggest city in South Africa and its economic hub, is
one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world has a population of more
than 4.43 million, according to the 2011 census. The city lies in the
Gauteng province, which experienced a spike in the number of free
Internet providers. Now, 80 percent of the country's 2,100 public
hotspots are deployed in the province. The majority of households use
cellular data to connect to the Internet, and the ratio of cellular
telephone subscriptions to people is 1.5:1.

South Africa has focused on information and communications technology
(ICT) development in Johannesburg, which also benefits from very
competitive mobile prepaid rates. Broadband in the county as a whole,
however, remains expensive compared to other developing nations.
Broadband subscription penetration is low, namely 5.3 subscriptions per
100 people, and speeds are not commensurate with cost. With an eye
toward developing better broadband infrastructure, the government's
"South Africa Connect" project set two goals: 90 percent of the South
African population should receive Internet at 5 megabits per second
(Mbps) and 50 percent of the country's population should connect at
average speeds of almost 100 Mbps. The Johannesburg municipality has
plans to install 1,000 Wi-Fi hotspots as well, and is contemplating a
900-kilometer-long network for households.

Project Description
===================

JAWUG is a nonprofit, community-maintained network in Johannesburg,
South Africa, that has operated since 2001. Users maintain their own
hardware; beyond this, the only cost is a small annual membership fee of
approximately US\$ 30. The network uses a license-free radio frequency,
and functions via a series of antennas or "high-sites" set up in line of
sight with each other. The intent is to create a backbone for a
community-owned and community-maintained wireless network. Interested
individuals who want to become involved check a database to see if one
of JAWUGs eight high sites or another user's antenna is in a direct line
of sight to where they would set up their own antenna. Users who connect
directly to high sites can see speeds of up to 300 Mbps; however,
general speeds vary, sometimes being as slow as 2 Mbps.

JAWUG does not provide Internet service, but they do offer members
industry recognition through their ties to groups such as the Internet
Service Providers Association (ISPA). At its current capacity, it costs
less than US\$ 1,000 to run JAWUG annually, and is run by a core group
of eight volunteers. Setting up a high-site costs between US\$ 800 and
US\$ 1,200, which is paid for through membership dues as well as
fundraising from the community and potential future community members
(e.g., those who live in line of sight to a new high-site).

Progress and Results
====================

While successful for a time, JAWUG is only used by a skeleton crew of
its former population. Originally the brainchild of four university
students seeking to create a single tower to determine if their idea was
viable, JAWUG consisted of 15 or more towers and 100-120 users at the
height of its popularity. Now, the population is approximately 15
regular users as well as the eight individuals who maintain the network.
The enthusiasm of this core group seems to ensure that the network will
continue, however. Evidence from JAWUG's Facebook page seems to show a
small trickle of newly interested parties as well as users who, having
moved, are interested in attempting to reconnect. In its current form,
it is primarily used for networked online gaming sessions, such as
massive-multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). There are
currently eight high-sites, many having been decommissioned after being
destroyed by lightning.

In addition to the success of testing the viability of using the
technology they employed, one of JAWUG's major outcomes was improved
technological literacy of those who became involved with the project.
Many who worked on JAWUG have continued on to corporate careers in the
fields of information technology and computer science. Yet, the general
hobbyist bent of the project also drew interest from individuals whose
vocations had little to do with ICTs. For many, joining the JAWUG
network was an introduction into network science.

The size of the community around the network has dwindled as Internet
service became more pervasive and cheaper in Johannesburg. Commercial
providers offer simpler solutions that consumers are more comfortable
with. Though JAWUG has seemingly become superfluous in a competitive
Internet service provider (ISP) market such as Johannesburg, it was
originally intended as a community, not an Internet portal. Albeit
small, the remaining users have been considerably successful in this
community.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of trust --** People were distrustful that the network was
"free," and were mistrustful of the founders. The open nature of the
network also allows for the potential of abuse. Individuals take
advantage of the infrastructure created by the original project for
their ends.

**Lack of a business model --** Some participants did not realize that
JAWUG was not providing an Internet gateway. Others would complain when
aspects of the network failed, often not realizing the voluntary nature
of the deployment.

**Regulation --** South African regulations prevented JAWUG from
providing Internet over the network without a license. The organization
faced pressures to become an ISP, and disregard the illegality of the
action. JAWUG choose not to, however, and it was eventually granted an
exemption license contingent on its continued status as nonprofit.

**Rough weather --** Many of the high-sites had to be decommissioned
because they were struck by lightning. Because the technology relies on
maintaining a line of sight, both weather and topography can present
challenges.

JAWUG's Suggestions for Future Projects
=======================================

**Users can provide insightful feedback for sustainability and growth
--** JAWUG notes that users can provide insightful feedback for
augmentations and quality assurance. Their experience demonstrates the
value of end user input. In addition, the nonprofit nature of the
venture dictates that participants have useful expertise beyond the
realm of information technology, and this can be a useful cost-cutting
measure (e.g., JAWUG's accountant is a community member who donates
time). Finally, identifying potential future users by their adjacency to
new high-sites may add value, and reduce costs of new towers through
donations.

**Success is need-dependent --** At the time of its implementation,
JAWUG filled a void since wireless Internet in Johannesburg cost
approximately US\$ 100 a month. As the marketplace improved, extra labor
needed to set up and connect to JAWUG was less attractive to potential
new users. For this reason, the popularity of JAWUG peaked and has
fallen ever since.
