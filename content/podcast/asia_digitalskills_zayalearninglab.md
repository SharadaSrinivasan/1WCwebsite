In this podcast, Professor Christopher Yoo from 1 World Connected interviews Harmik Singh, Chief Operating Officer, Zaya Learning Labs. Zaya Learning Lab is a non-profit organization providing Wi-Fi access to low-income, English-language schools in India. Established in 2013, their unique learning-focused connectivity devices provide Internet access and educational content at a much lower cost than a regular, open Internet-enabled Wi-Fi connection. Zaya seeks to tailor connectivity solutions to the needs of a specific region, culture, and institution, and leverages technical and person-to-person communication to make Internet access an effective tool for education.
