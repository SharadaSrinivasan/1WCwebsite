### A Challenging Connectivity Climate

Zimbabwe, a land-locked country of 14 million people, is situated in
Southern Africa. In recent years, political challenges and currency
inflation has affected economic stability. Due to this instability,
infrastructure development has taken a secondary focus. Reliable power
is one of the daily challenges that many Zimbabweans face, especially
those in remote and rural areas. The majority of the population, 72%,
lives at or below the poverty line, and Zimbabwe has some of the world's
lowest Internet penetration rates - approximately 16%. Internet access
is costly and is estimated to be 30% of the GNI per capita income of
$840 -- much higher than the ITU's 5% threshold for access. Zimbabwe
proves to be a challenging climate for Internet connectivity. Mobile
towers require constant power, Internet devices require power, and the
price of access needs to be affordable to enable consumption. The local
solution: off-grid cell phone towers from Econet Wireless.

### Tower Power 

In 2013, Econet Wireless implemented the first off-grid mobile towers
that were tethered to turbines, diesel generators and even solar energy
to provide continuous power. This was aptly referred to as 'Tower
Power'. For some areas of Zimbabwe, this was the first time that
electricity is available.

The energy sources provided needed power to the mobile towers and
provided excess power for secondary initiatives. For example, excess
energy from the mobile towers is used to power refrigerators for
vaccinations at medical clinics in some villages in Zimbabwe. The
rationale for keeping the vaccines refrigerated is that shelf life is
increased, and the vaccination rate of vulnerable communities is
increased by making preventative medicine available. Econet partnered
with the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health to build 100 sites across the
country, and has plans to build additional sites to increase vaccination
rates and reduce mortality rates of preventative diseases. The Program
is called "Energize the Chain" and has distributed over 250,000 vaccines
to date.

The excess power supply also can be used for personal use as the
electricity can be installed in a home for $6.00 and costs $1.00 a
month. Access to power provides opportunities for individuals in
communities. They are able to buy chargeable phones and Internet devices
without the fear of not being able to power them.

Econet Wireless proves that implementing mobile towers in rural
communities provides many opportunities. They increase mobile
connectivity, but also increase quality of life and critical healthcare
opportunities.
