The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has a population of 77.51 million
inhabitants and is considered one of the world's poorest countries.
Nearly two -thirds of the population - 63% - are considered to be living
below the poverty line. Due to the DRC's overall poverty rate, only 7%
of the population has access to broadband connections. On the island of
Idjwi in the middle of Lake Kivu, an estimated 250,000 people reside who
earn less than \$1 a day. With such a low daily per capita income, there
are very few Internet equipped devices on the island. The Island is 70
km from the DRC mainland, where the nearest Internet access points are
located. It is nearly isolated from the web.

**The Development of a Network**

In 2016, two organizations teamed up to deploy a network on Idjwi. These
organizations were, Ensemble Pour La Difference, a Non-Profit
Organization whose mission is to empower the community in the Kivu
region in business and technology initiatives, and Fjord, an innovation
consultancy firm in the UK. Their objective was to connect the community
to the web through a center where residents could get news, health
information and weather through a public display system, using Wi-Fi
access points. The center possesses a number of tablets and Raspberry
Pi's to connect to the Net. The network was named 'Pamoja Net'. Pamoja
in Swahili translates to "togetherness".

Both organizations studied population trends, and determined that the
ideal location of the 'makeshop' would be in Bugarula - Idjwi's busiest
public market. A Mesh network was created between Bugarula and Bukuvu,
the mainland's closest Internet access point. The network was first
tested on an island off the coast of Scotland, providing an accurate
replication of the conditions on Idjwi. Once the network functioned in
Scotland, the network was transported to Idjwi and deployed.

At the makeshop, a display monitor is connected to the phone of Idjwi's
King, Mwami Gervais Rubenga. The King uses his phone to access data and
provide updates on the monitor regarding news, health information, and
weather reports.

Idjwi residents often travel to the mainland to sell their goods and the
weather reports let them know if it is safe to travel. Previously, there
were weather updates, and residents would travel across the lake in
rough conditions that led to many people drowning. The residents also
can use the Internet to determine current pricing of their commodities
to ensure they receive favorable rates on their goods. are so that they
are not taken advantage of.

Another benefit of the network - residents of Idjiwi can utilize
Internet access anonymously. If a citizen in the DRC wants to purchase a
smart phone, they are required to disclose their identity when signing
up. Using Pamoja Net, citizens do not need to disclose their identity
and can purchase access at the makeshop for around \$2 a month to freely
surf the web and learn about current events in the country and not be
suppressed or have content censored.

The Pamoja Net project provides an effective means to bring Internet to
Idjwi. Through its implementation, the network has improved safety,
e-commerce and human rights. The network continues to function today
improving a number of Idjwi residents lives.
