Established in 2013, Project Isizwe launched in Pretoria with the simple
yet ambitious goal of bringing free Wi-Fi within walking distance of
every South African. A product of meaningful private and public sector
partnership, the project has set up thousands of free Wi-Fi hotspots
throughout South Africa.

Compared to other African countries, internet connection in South Africa
costs significantly more---costing between 7% and 20% of a family's
income. For this reason, Project Isizwe found it necessary to set up
free hubs for internet access in one of South Africa's capital cities,
Pretoria, with a population over 2.1 million.

When it started in 2013, the project only had 35 Wi-Fi hotspots with a
250 megabyte daily limit for each device. Thanks to a partnership
between the government, telecommunication companies, and local NGOS, the
project today has 1,050 free Wi-Fi hotspots with a 500 megabyte daily
allowance. Local companies provide the necessary labor and bandwidth at
a discounted rate, and the project coordinates with municipal and city
governments to subsidize free internet access to community centers such
as schools, clinics and libraries. To enhance the relevance of these new
hotspots, local NGOs have developed online digital literacy programs. As
a result of this hard work and collaboration, Project Isizwe has had
three million unique users with 600,000 unique users per month and
333,000 people connecting to the net every day!

Project Isizwe does not stop at providing free Wi-Fi access. The NGO
recognizes that digital literacy and access to resources are just as
important as connection itself if users are going to gain the full
social and economic benefits of internet connection. For this reason
Project Isizwe has teamed up with several technology companies to
enhance opportunities for internet users. When connecting to Project
Isizwe's Wi-Fi, users have access to online portals with information on
education and job opportunities. These online portals have led 11,000
citizens to complete online digital literacy training and helped
hundreds of others find employment. Additionally, Mozilla created an
online platform for the project to connect low-income women with health
and financial resources.

Project Isizwe is steadily reaching its goal of connecting low-income
communities across South Africa to free Wi-Fi hubs. The NGO's work
flourishes thanks to its collaboration with community members, local
government and business. Its success is further attributable to its
recognition that meaningful internet access involves connecting new
users with educational and employment opportunities. By following these
simple principles, Project Isizwe has successfully connected millions to
the web and provided economic opportunities to thousands in South
Africa.
