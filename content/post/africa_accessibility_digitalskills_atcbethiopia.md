Ethiopia, a population of 100 million residents is one of Africa's most
developed countries. On the ICT and technology side Ethiopia has a
unique situation where Internet access is under the government of
Ethiopia's control. There is very little competition. Internet access is
provided nation-wide by Ethio Telecom. This allows the government to
control the marketplace and set pricing and licensing of Internet. In
doing so it creates some difficulties for providing Internet and
communications across the country as access to competitively priced
communications is limited. Mobile phone penetration in Ethiopia is only
at around 40% of the population, and only 2% of the population have
fixed-line Internet connections in their homes. In order for the
majority of Ethiopians to access the web they rely on Internet Cafés as
Internet access points.

Ethiopia is also home to around 500,000 residents that are visually
impaired and ICT technologies and training are critical to allow these
individuals the opportunity to work and live independent lives. ICTs and
Internet are critical as they provide a vehicle for empowerment to learn
and access information. Libraries and other resources in Ethiopia can
only accommodate visually impaired persons to a limited degree, but the
Internet provides a near infinite opportunity for knowledge and
employment.

The Adaptive Technology Center for The Blind (ATCB) set up the Pioneers
Collegiate for the Blind, a training center that provides visually
challenged citizens the opportunity to learn vocational skills and basic
computer skills to improve their quality of life. In 2008, the ATCB
received a license from the government to operate as the Technical
Vocational and Education Training (TVET) institute. Since 2008 the TVET
annually has trained a cohort of 20 -30 individuals. The ATCB organizes
events to build capacity and awareness in assistance technologies
partnering with UNESCO, ITU, and the Internet Society.

The ATCB has built an Internet Café in the center of Addis Ababa with 10
computer terminals equipped with adaptive technologies and
text-to-speech translation software that enable visually challenged
users to utilize the Internet at their ease. The Center also houses a
Braille Transcription Center that houses over 2000 texts and literature
in both English and Amharic.

The ATCB provides a haven for those with visual impairments to empower
themselves, and to access the Internet in a country where it is a
challenge for those without impairments to access the web. The center
has provided these individuals with skills and knowledge that they can
apply in the real world to gain employment, and the opportunity to live
fruitful and independent lives that would not otherwise be possible
without the use of ICTs and access to the Internet.
