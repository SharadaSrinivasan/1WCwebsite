Executive Summary 
==================

The city of San Jose, California, and the Kansas-based
telecommunications operator Sprint partnered to provide free mobile
hotspots and wireless Internet to help close the city's "homework gap"
in Fall 2017. As schools learn to incorporate hybrid-learning
pedagogies, students need access to the Internet in order to complete
their homework. The project identifies those in need based on whether or
not they are eligible for the free or reduced cost lunch program, who do
not already have Internet at home. They provide eligible students with a
mobile phone or tablet as well as monthly Internet and voice services
free of charge until they graduate. The project serves students at a
total of 48 schools in San Jose so far, and aims to serve 10,000
students over the next five years.

Context
=======

Despite being the capital of Silicon Valley and the richest American
city in 2015, San Jose, CA, also has one of the largest income
inequality gaps in the country. Affordability became the main reason for
unconnected areas. According to Shireen Santosham, chief innovation
officer in the San José Mayor's Office, a significant part of the
population has an income of less than \$25,000 a year. More than 12
percent of the city's households, and more than 40 percent of the
residents with incomes under \$20,000, have no household Internet access
-- amounting to around 95,000 residents. This amounts to 100,000 being
left out on the path to digitalization, a divide that cannot be
overlooked and unaddressed given that the city is surrounded by wealth
and technology.

San Jose's Smart City Vision for an Inclusive City envisages
opportunities for all businesses, organizations, and residents' to
participate in and benefit from Silicon Valley's culture of innovation
through "free or low-cost, high-speed, 1 gigabyte (GB) or faster
broadband service in several low-income communities, and increasing
access to hardware, including tablets and laptops, for low-income
students." The city, in partnership with the East Side Union High School
District, launched free outdoor Wi-Fi services for students, their
families, and other community members. It also partnered with Facebook
to provide affordable or free broadband service at street level via
Terragraph technology, potentially benefiting thousands of residents.

Project Description
===================

The project is based on an access model launched by Sprint called the 1
Million Project, which aims to close the homework gap among high school
students by providing those without a reliable Internet access at their
homes with devices and free high-speed Internet access. As a part of
this initiative, Sprint partnered with the city of San Jose to serve
under-resourced high school students. Students who do not have home
access to the Internet are eligible for the program. Students are
guaranteed 3 GB of high-speed LTE data a month on the Sprint network and
unlimited data at 2G speeds if usage exceeds that limit throughout the
students' four years of high school. For students receiving a
smartphone, the device will feature unlimited voice and texting while on
the Sprint network. Internet service is provided to the device, rather
than the household, free of charge. Additionally, every device comes
with a safety filter that blocks adult content and malware, helping
students focus on their studies.

Currently, the project serves students at a total of 48 schools across
the San Jose Unified, Campbell Union, and East Side Union high school
districts. East Side Union District has students from the most
underserved communities in San Jose, with a high percentage of students
who need Internet access. In one school in that district, Andrew Hill
High School, 63 percent of students are eligible for the program. There
are similar numbers for Independence and James Lick high schools, and
many others in the district.

Progress and Results
====================

The project serves a total of 48 schools and will serve 10,000 students
over the course of five years, providing them with devices (mobile phone
or tablet, but not laptops) and Internet service. The project plans to
expand the roster of devices on offer on the basis of which devices
student predominantly use for homework, likely to include laptops.

Challenges
==========

**Device maintenance --** It is a challenge and a financial burden to
keep back-up devices on hand to replace lost, damaged, or stolen
devices.

Sprint's Suggestions for Future Projects
========================================

**Government involvement can be beneficial --** To circumvent
bureaucracy and streamline service the project's coordinators found that
it is pragmatic to collaborate with the government who are controlling
the project's implementation protocol for different sectors.
