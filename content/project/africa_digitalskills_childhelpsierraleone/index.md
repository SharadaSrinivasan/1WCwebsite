Executive Summary 
==================

ChildHelp Sierra Leone is a recognized nongovernmental organization
(NGO) founded in 1994. It is a social humanitarian organization with the
national mandate to help child and youth through development, advocacy,
and relief. After the Ebola crisis, ChildHelp aims to keep female
students in school and encourage those who have never been enrolled to
attend. ChildHelp focuses on the most marginalized and underserviced
young women in particular communities of Sierra Leone and other parts of
Africa. They provide technology to schools as well as offer school
scholarships, mentoring for young women and distance learning facilities
to older women. ChildHelp is an example of a multi-pronged intervention
that needs a permanent funding pipeline.

Context
=======

Sierra Leone is small country located on the west coast of Africa. Since
2002, the country has been in the process of rebuilding itself after a
long and devastating civil war. Gender discrimination, violence against
women and girls, and detrimental traditional practices aimed at
disempowering women continue to be rampant. According to a 2013 UNICEF
report, 88 percent of girls and women in Sierra Leone have undergone
female genital mutilation, and 39 percent of girls are married by the
age of 18. Partially attributed to these factors, Sierra Leone has the
fifth-highest maternal mortality rate in the world.

Children in Sierra Leone are required to attend six years of primary
education and three years of secondary education, but a shortage of
schools and teachers has prevented effective implementation. According
to UNDP, 9.5 percent of adult women access secondary education or
higher, compared to 20 percent for men. The lack of education is a main
contributor to child bride practices. According to a World Bank report,
girls with no education are up to six times more likely to marry than
girls with a high school education. There are, however, both local and
national initiatives targeting education for girls, which has brought
the country a long way since the end of the war in 2002. One such
initiative implemented by the government of Sierra Leone is the "Let
Girls be Girls, Not Mothers" project, which is a two-year-long national
initiative with an aim to reduce teenage pregnancy rate. Sierra Leone is
also one of 12 countries selected to be a part of UNFPA and UNICEF's
Global Program to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage. There are
also local projects such as the Girl2Girl Empowerment Movement, which,
through leadership and ICT training, support and educate girls about
their rights, as well as sexual and reproductive health.

Project Description
===================

Through partnerships with several organizations, ChildHelp helps young
women enroll in, return to, and stay in school. By increasing the
educational opportunities afforded these young women, ChildHelp is
working to end child marriage. Their current staff is composed of 23
individuals, 12 full-time employees, five part-time, and six volunteers.

One of ChildHelp's most successful projects was "Unleashing the Power of
Adolescent Girl's Network through Information Communication
Technologies" (UPAG/ICT). In partnership with the Internet Society
(ISOC), ChildHelp provided digital literacy training and technology to
students, female and male, in four different communities spread over
three district areas. In these areas, ChildHelp built rooms that include
technology and an Internet connection.

ChildHelp is completely funded through donations. This includes larger
donations from corporations, nonprofits, and NGOs as well as aggressive
campaigns on crowdfunding sites such as Global Giving Foundation,
Indiegogo, and GoFundMe. Through crowdfunding, ChildHelp has raised US\$
46,000.

From 2007-2008, the project serviced more than 450 students through ISOC
funding. The following year, UPAG/ICT reached 600 of the most isolated
and disenfranchised young women in the communities as well as 300 male
students. This two-year endeavor was paid for by a US\$ 20,000 grant
from ISOC.

Progress and Results
====================

ChildHelp has distributed more than 50 computers to various schools and
ICT rooms for use by youth. In addition to the UPAG/ICT project, they
provide scholarships, computer training, and access to the Internet to
approximately 600 young women a year.An evaluation of the UPAG/ICT
program for the 2008-09 academic year through in-depth interviews with
community members yielded promising results. Respondents lauded UPAG/ICT
for giving young women a safe place to congregate and a peer network to
engage. Additionally, more than 90 percent of the young women
interviewed at the completion of the project reported learning
information that empowers them, from the program. More than 90 percent
of young men realized that, as a result of their participation in
UPAG/ICT, they were behaving inappropriately to women in their own
households. At the completion of the 2008-09 academic year, ChildHelp
turned the program over to a new organization called Champion Girls
Club.

Building on their previous successes, ChildHelp has initiated a Girl
Power project to help two "forgotten" new districts in Sierra Leone,
Karene and Falaba, which were decimated by recent Ebola outbreak. In
these areas, ChildHelp focuses on helping young women between the ages
of 10-19 who have either left school or never attended. It leverages
ICTs for this purpose.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding --** ChildHelp often receives one-off grants
that are not enough to sustain in the long term. Donations through the
Global Giving Foundation, Anne Frank Fonds and Bradley families do not
help meet the scholarship funds needed for 600 girls during the 2017-18
academic year. This severely cripples the reach and implementation
potential of the organization.

**Lack of transportation infrastructure --** ChildHelp only owns a
single car and two used motorbikes. Sometimes their students have to
walk miles to school. They would like to provide a bus for or bicycles
to the students to make this commute easier.

**Lack of access to devices** **--** Schools in the northern region of
Sierra Leone lack ICT materials and tools. One of the 20 schools has
between two and five computers at their disposal. Rural schools still do
not have access to computers and the use of Internet. More refurbished
computers, printers, and its accessories, including Internet facilities,
are needed in strategic places for the rural communities to access ICTs.

ChildHelp's Suggestions for Future Projects
===========================================

**Strong partnerships are essential --** ChildHelp reports that building
strong ties within the communities they service has been their strongest
asset. With heavy community involvement, unplanned issues that arise are
more quickly solved. ChildHelp also forms strong bonds with governmental
departments, such as those addressing social welfare and education.
