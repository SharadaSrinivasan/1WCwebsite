Executive Summary 
==================

Kedesa is a web-based e-government platform developed and implemented
nationally across Indonesia. The platform is implemented by the
nonprofit research organization PATTIRO. Launched in July 2016, the
project's purpose is to enable stakeholder participation to monitor
local government and implementation of the Village Law through online
discussion and information exchange. Kedesa.id is an online portal
integrating four platforms: a blog, a wiki, a document repository, and a
discussion forum. The blog contains short articles on the implementation
of laws by users. The wiki provides an annotated version of the law that
the users can contribute to. The repository hosts documents related to
the implementation of village governance, including policies, reports,
and studies on the practice of village governance. The forum serves as
an online interactive discussion medium.

Context
============

Indonesia aspires to become a "just and democratic, and peaceful and
united" country, according to the National Long-Term Development Plan
(2005-2025). The National Medium-Term Development Plan of 2015-2019 aims
to implement a clean, effective, democratic, and reliable government.
Information and communications technologies (ICTs) are recognized by the
government as an important means to attain this goal. As such, Indonesia
has made significant efforts to expand the network and improve Internet
use across the country.

The Village Law enacted in 2014 is a significant piece of legislation to
come into force since Indonesia commenced its decentralization process
in 2001. The law requires the central government to allocate funding
annually to Indonesia's 74,093 villages to enable local self-government.
Local governments are in the process of adjusting to this decentralized
government approach. For communities not used to participating in
decision-making processes, communication among all the stakeholders is
crucial to an inclusive, democratic government.

Project Description
===================

Kedesa is an online platform to promote stakeholder participation and
improve communication regarding the implementation of Village Law
between the Village Ministry and Ministry of Home Affairs, the district
government, village heads, implementers, the representative council of a
village, village facilitators, and residents. Kedesa is a project of
PATTIRO, a research and advocacy organization established in 1999 to
help promote transparency and equitable governance in Indonesia. PATTIRO
assists the community in conducting advocacy with the central and local
government to encourage policy reform as well as public service and
public finance management improvement.

The Kedesa platform integrates four platforms. A wiki provides users
with information on the law and enables real-time collaborative
contributions to maximize its readability. An online discussion platform
allows users to discuss and exchange information on village development
and related issues. A blog encourages users to write a personal journal
on their views on topics related to the Village Law and village
development. The website [www.kedesa.id](http://www.kedesa.id) also
functions as a data repository for legislative and regulatory documents.
This enables village stakeholders to access, cite, download, and share
data.

The project was developed to combat corruption, provide greater
autonomy, and create a discussion platform for multiple stakeholders.
Since Internet availability in villages is low, the project is
complemented by an offline platform for discussion among the
stakeholders to raise awareness and overcome infrastructure challenges.
Kedesa also facilitates a WhatsApp group of 160 participants and uses
social media platforms for promotion.

Progress and Results
====================

As of 2017, Kedesa serves 74,000 villages, 34 provinces, and 530
district governments.

Kedesa seeks to be a feedback mechanism and platform for multi-channel
communication between the various parties to Village Law. This requires
strategic and innovative use of communication methods and media.
Infrastructural challenges have presented major obstacles to the
implementation of an online platform as several villages do not have
Internet access yet, and information dissemination outside of the
government structure is difficult.

While Kedesa was widely adopted initially during the rollout period,
public reporting, and adoption has dwindled. Efforts to augment the
Kedesa online platform with offline face-to-face meetings and discussion
forums that seek to restore communication, but it is not clear that
those meetings translate back into increased online adoption. This may
be due to insufficient awareness since media channels have different
adoption rates, and advertising for Kedesa has been uneven across them.
It could also potentially be due to disillusionment about government
transparency and/or dissatisfaction with efficacy of their participation
in government.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of infrastructure --** Lack of Internet connectivity presents a
major obstacle to substantial online participation. The organization
reports that face-to-face discussions were successful in getting
multiple stakeholders to discuss village-related issues in ways that the
online platform has not yet been able to replicate.

**Lack of village level contributors --** PATTIRO continues to face a
challenge in increasing community participation in the online platform
to form an effective feedback loop.

**Uneven investment across stakeholders and a lack of ministerial
support** **--** Ministry media channels have been resistant to
publicizing and utilizing the Kedesa platform, hampering its outreach to
villages where this is the main mode of communication.

PATTIRO's Suggestions for Future Projects
=========================================

**Online platforms require offline service complementation for
e-governance services --** Formal and informal offline discussions help
augment the adoption and use of Kedesa, and the implementation of the
community insights expressed online.

**Stakeholder identification and communication for outreach plays a role
in ensuring success --** Key stakeholders, their roles and
responsibilities in the feedback loop mechanism as well as knowledge and
involvement, can help make the system more relevant and effective.
