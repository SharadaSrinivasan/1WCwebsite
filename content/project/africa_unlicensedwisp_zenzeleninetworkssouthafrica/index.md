Executive Summary 
==================

Zenzeleni Networks is a community network in Mankosi in the Eastern Cape
province of South Africa, set up in 2012. It started through a
collaboration between researchers at the University of Western Cape and
the Tribal Authority in Mankosi. It provides affordable communications
access to its 3500 residents, at half the price charged by the
then-incumbent operator.

Context
=======

Mankosi has 564 households, with an overall population of 3500.
Sixty-one percent of the population is over 15 years of age, and about
70 percent of the population is female. Only 2.1 percent have access to
the electricity grid, and 13 percent complete high school. However, 97.7
percent of the population own a mobile phone, and spend up to 1/3^rd^ of
their disposable income on connectivity.

Most of Mankosi's 3,500 residents live on less than US\$ 2 per day, and
due to high economic impoverishment, less than a quarter used to be able
to be online in a month. Most households do not have savings and 58.6
per cent of the residents do not own a bank account.

Project Description
===================

The Zenzeleni network initially comprised a mesh network of 12
single-radio wireless nodes scattered around an area of 30 square
kilometers. Since 2012, a research team from University of Western Cape
actively started engaging with the Mankosi community, and began
installation as well as training the community members to host base
stations at their households. These houses were chosen to maximize reach
of the network, as Mankosi's twelve villages were in hilly terrain.
Local community members learned to fit the aerials, with solar panels
and Mesh Potatoes on rooftops, and made wooden boxes to hold the
batteries.

Initally, public phones were able to call villages within the community,
with an eventual shift to mobile phones on other networks. The system
also had a mechanism of revenue generation through charging of the
mobile phones at base stations. The committee decided to keep
intra-community calls free, but charges for calling mobile phones.
Besides these communal phones, Zenzeleni provides internet at low cost
to the local school, small businesses and NGOs.

Zenzeleni Networks is registered as a co-operative, and was able to do
business with a Voice over Internet Protocol company to place calls to
other networks (cellular or landline) for 17% of the normal cost. The
co-op charges users 50% of the normal price charged by the incumbent,
reducing costs drastically for community members. The billing uses voice
menus in IsiXhosa, to cater to local community needs.

Progress and Results
====================

Zenzeleni's focus is now on setting up backhaul to a fiber network in
the nearest city, using a series of wireless relay towers. They have
undergone a network upgrade in early 2017. The project has also setup
computer labs in the primary and secondary schools and a community WiFi
network with donated personal computers (PCs) to provide access to those
without smart phones. Zenzeleni's cooperative board sets rates for the
services provided by the network, including costs for charging and
calling. Zenzeleni is also involved in training of trainers in Mankosi,
and has expanded the network in key ways. Further, Zenzeleni has
conducted a digital skill needs assessment, and is gathering educational
content for its digital literacy outreach initiatives.

Challenges
==========

**Coordination challenges --** Implementing community-owned initiatives
takes considerable time to negotiate with local power structures and the
tribal authority. Coordinating meetings can be challenging due to the
lack of electricity. Scarcity of resources necessitates an eye toward
considerate appropriation of network resources, and the culture of
community work must be respected. This often requires more time than
conventional implementations of networks, and can take up to 18 months.

**Social norms: gender norms** **--** Patriarchal ecosystems often make
it difficult to sustain women's participation in the running of a
community network. A woman's responsibilities at home makes it difficult
for her to sustain long-term attendance at training. While three women
appeared in the very first sessions of the training, only one could make
it to further sessions.

**Social norms --** A community hierarchical structure often poses
unique challenges to governance. Working with the tribal authority was
chosen as it is the one structure that convenes weekly meetings and
exists across all villages in the community. However, as in all
communities, perceptions on who is privileged by decisions made by those
in power differ significantly and poses challenges that must be overcome
by transparent and effective communication.

Zenzeleni's Suggestions for Future Projects
===========================================

**Appreciation and deep respect of the socio-cultural complexities of
the context before deployment of a community-owned network in a rural
community is helpful to improve take-up within the community** --
According to Zenzeleni, working with the community is essential for
success of community led projects. Tailoring training and digital
literacy efforts to suit local needs is essential to ensuring success of
community-wide education initiatives.

**Self-sufficient funding models and participation from all members of
the community is necessary to be successful** -- Zenzeleni's team
emphasizes the necessity for developing a collaborative and cooperative
model to fund and maintain a community network in order to ensure long
term sustainability.
