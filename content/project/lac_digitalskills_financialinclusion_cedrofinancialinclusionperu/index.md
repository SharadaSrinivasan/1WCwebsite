Executive Summary 
==================

From 2016 to 2018, the Center for Information and Education for the
Prevention of Drug Abuse (CEDRO) in Peru ran a financial inclusion
program for 5,000 women for information and communications technology
(ICT) literacy and economic training, as well as a select group of 380
women specifically for entrepreneurial training. With support from the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Comités
de Pobladores, the program trains women who then train others in groups
of 20-25. The programs equip women with business and financial
organizational skills, as well as a solid foundation in digital literacy
and e-commerce. They have initiated 38 technology centers in three
regions in Peru

Context
=======

Banking and finance continue to be a vexing developmental challenge in
Peru. Only 29 percent Peruvian adults had a formal financial account in
2014, despite being ranked the best enabling environment for
microfinance and financial inclusion, according to the World Bank.
Furthermore, Peru is committed to empowering at least 75 percent of its
adult citizens with access to an electronic transaction-enabled bank
account by 2021. In line with this goal, the government launched its
National Financial Inclusion Strategy in 2015, which promotes the use of
electronic transaction instruments, access to savings, insurance and
financing, consumer protection, and financial education programs.
Financial inclusion is a priority because it helps mitigate the shocks
and risks that households might face, as well as increases productivity
and assets for businesses.

According to the Thunderbird School of Global Management, 98 percent of
all businesses in Peru were micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises
(MSMEs) -- 40 percent of which were owned and operated by women. Their
need for credit is substantial, and many have not previously engaged in
electronic banking or possessed sufficient digital literacy skills. Of
the 83,000 new Peruvian customers added in 2016, for instance, 51
percent were women, while 43.5 percent were accessing banking services
for the first time, according to the BBVA Microfinance Foundation.

Various agencies have created programs to provide digital literacy and
financial inclusion training to Peruvians. In 2010, the Thunderbird
School of Global Management, in collaboration with other government and
private sector institutions, implemented the Strengthening Women
Entrepreneurs in Peru that benefited 100,000 women micro-entrepreneurs
and 700 women-led small enterprises. Financiera Confianza, a leader of
microfinance sector in Peru, provides financial education to
entrepreneurs through its group credit that serves 30,000 customers,
Woman's Word, and its Savings for Everyone (Ahorro para Todos) program.

Project Description
===================

The project is designed to empower women through education in ICT,
business, and finance. The goal is to reform economic participation at
the household level, and to empower women to make money and create
opportunities for themselves, each other, their families, and the
region.

The program consists of three areas of education. First is the digital
literacy program, which includes 100 hours of training, and three
modules: basic, intermediate, and advanced. The second area is financial
education, which includes eight hours of training on topics including
savings, budget, how to manage debts, and financial services. The third
area is entrepreneurship training, which includes 12 hours of
instruction covering topics such as how to create competency,
initiatives of ideas, how to create a business plan and implement it,
and how to legally set up businesses. The curricula across these
branches also involve topics on gender empowerment and leadership. The
pre-condition to participate in the program is that women are already
part of Peru's social inclusion program, so the financial inclusion and
digital inclusion programs target women who are under-served and
marginalized geographically and economically.

Progress and Results
====================

The program operates 38 technology centers equipped with Wi-Fi and
eight-to-10 computers each, in the cities of San Martin, Huanuco, and
Ucuyali. The site has 29,000 unique users, and 30,000 followers on
social media.

The program monitors its impact with user surveys, where 95 percent of
users report that they use ICTs in their daily lives and are satisfied
with the service. Moreover, 85 percent of women trained report changes
in their financial wellness and leadership capacity.

The program has developed a successful model for sustainability. After
programs are developed and initiated, they are transferred to local
governments, Comités de Aliados, financial replicators, and women
themselves. The Comités de Pobladores supports the implementation beyond
the intervention of USAID, and support is maintained through two
teleconferences held each month in each region.

Challenges
==========

**Low take-up --** Support for the program is strong among the women who
have participated, but adoption and user acquisition remain challenging.
Advertising the program has limited impact on changes in behavior as
well, as it has been difficult to convincingly convey to women the
potential benefits of the program on their life quality and financial
stability.

**Coordination challenges --** While the program has a strong model for
sustainability in place, it involves the initiative and cooperation of
many different parties. It can be difficult to coordinate the efforts of
the various government ministries and persons involved to keep the
project going, despite its demonstrably positive outcomes.

**Rigid social norms on gender roles --** The program is designed to
empower women in a social system in which men are in control. Husbands
are consequently often resistant to the idea of their wives
participating in the program and are resistant to the larger concept of
their wives having autonomous control over family finances.

CEDRO's Suggestions for Future Projects
=======================================

**Private sector contribution is useful and should be actively solicited
in order to ensure sustainability --** Donated licenses, software,
hardware, and electronics from private sector technology companies make
initiatives like these possible. Further, the ability of corporate
social responsibility initiatives to fund such initiatives makes them a
natural collaborative partner to advance mutually beneficial outcomes.
