Executive Summary 
=======================

My Digital Bridge Foundation launched a pilot project to test TV white
space spectrum use viability in Namibia in 2014. Known as Citizen
Connect, the project aimed to provide broadband to rural settlements via
unused frequencies in the ultra high frequency (UHF) terrestrial
television broadcasting bands. The pilot was launched in the northern
region of Namibia. The project has faced funding and regulatory
challenges in initiating a countrywide rollout but succeeded in
connecting 27 schools and seven Ministry of Education offices.

Context
=======

Namibia is a sparsely populated sub-Saharan African country with less
than 2.5 million inhabitants spread over 824,292 kilometers. Namibia has
one of the highest income inequality rates in the world, in part due to
the separation between urban and rural economies.

As of 2013, only 16 percent of households had Internet access at home,
which translates to slightly more than 40,000 asynchronous digital
subscriber line (ADSL) connections countrywide. This connectivity is
centered in urban areas; neither broadband nor mobile networks serve
vast portions in rural areas. Where available, broadband is unaffordable
to approximately 40 percent of Namibians. Comparing figures between 2013
and 2014, this financial inaccessibility explains why Internet
penetration in the country seems to be plateauing. In a comparison
between Namibia and other South African Development Community (SADC)
nations' Internet penetration, Namibia ranks 10^th^, trailing countries
with half its per capita income.

Project Description
===================

In 2014, My Digital Bridge Foundation launched a pilot program called
Citizen Connect that uses TVWS to offer connectivity to rural schools in
three northern Namibian regional councils -- Oshana, Ohangwena, and
Omusati. The project is supported by partnerships with Microsoft (under
its 4Afrika Initiative) and Adaptrum, as well as the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) and Millennium Challenge Account
(MCA)-Namibia. When it commenced, it was the largest TVWS project its
time in terms of area coverage.

The project employed TVWS supported by traditional 5 gigahertz (GHz)
equipment and solar-powered base stations to offer connectivity to rural
schools. Originally, the project intended to include 23 rural schools
and 10 of the educational offices that administer the schools.
Engagement with beneficiaries was part of a diffusion strategy adopted
to insure project success. This included consulting with the
beneficiaries, developing technological infrastructure, and training
community members, such as teachers, in maintaining this infrastructure.

Progress and Results
====================

The Namibian TVWS pilot project was successful in orchestrating
broadband to four more schools than expected, reaching 27 in all. They
fell slightly short of the targeted 10 administration offices, however,
only providing connectivity to seven. While the technology remains in
place to continue TVWS in the northern region, the government has
disallowed Citizen Connect to remain operational.

Though the technology is falling into disrepair from lack of use, My
Digital Bridge was able to implement the technological infrastructure
for future TVWS projects in northern Namibia. In addition, the Citizen
Connect project showed the viability of using this method to connect
rural regions to the Internet as well as its ability to be powered by
solar energy. Finally, while the project was functional, it helped
increase information and communications technology (ICT) literacy within
targeted communities.

Challenges
==========

**Regulatory challenges --** Hostile or inexpertly written regulatory
frameworks were a challenge to scaling the project. In the Namibian
example, a single, powerful, unfriendly individual in government worked
against scaling the project nationwide. Pushback from regulatory bodies
within the Namibian state has led to the project not being able to
continue.

**Coordination challenges --** Governmental indifference can make
physical deployment of necessary technologies difficult. For instance,
if a connection point needs to be situated in public spaces, it is much
harder to make this a reality without intervention from a government
official. This proved to be a continued challenge for the project. In
addition, the multiple actors involved also struggled with working in a
concerted way.

**Lack of sustained funding. --** While the pilot program was successful
and there were hopes that it would be scaled nationwide, both the means
of funding and implementing the project on a larger scale were not
discussed early enough in the project.

My Digital Bridge Foundation's Suggestions for Future Projects
==============================================================

**TVWS helps to connect challenging terrains --** The project team notes
that TVWS can help rural areas with no broadband Internet connectivity
and can be easily deployed. It is not disrupted by landscape features
(e.g., valleys) nor fabricated structures because of its reliance on
non-line-of-sightÂ (NLOS) technology.

**Soliciting government support is important --** Outright governmental
hostility can completely impede or stop a project. Governmental
indifference is likewise problematic. Their experience suggests how it
is important to increase the friendliness of both government and
regulatory bodies as much as possible to ensure a project's success.

**Local ICT literacy helps with adoption --** Projects such as Citizen
Connect expand ICT literacy in regions that have little to no
connectivity. Additionally, and due to the need for local maintainers of
the infrastructure, technical knowledge is diffused into the region. In
turn, these individuals can help further propagate and augment the
system through the frame of their indigeneity.

**Sustainable business models are necessary** -- As is the case with
many networks that are or have the potential to be free, projects of
this sort may benefit from contending with the general skittishness
around the term "free." Even though the Namibian TVWS project offered
the government a model that would allow them to completely subsidize the
cost of providing Internet to rural schools (via ad revenue), government
officials were distrustful and uncomprehending of how this could be
possible. Similarly, while it is imperative that connectivity is
affordable, offering it at a small cost bestows value on the service in
the eyes of its beneficiaries (i.e. because "nothing free can have
value").
