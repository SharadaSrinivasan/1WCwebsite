Executive Summary 
==================

The Hispano-American Health Link Foundation (EHAS) is a largely
European-funded research organization that has worked since 2004 to
provide voice and data access through infrastructure deployments in
isolated areas of Latin America. The organization's focus is on
providing sustainable low-cost Internet and networking technology
solutions to improve quality of life and life expectancy in rural
communities. With a focus on healthcare, EHAS aims to connect
underserved populations in developing countries to medical resources in
urban treatment centers and hospitals via telemedicine through their
TUCAN3G project.

Context
=======

Peru is highly centralized country - around nine million Peruvians out
of a total population of 31.1 million live in the capital city of Lima.
The government is constructing a 13,000-kilometer-long backbone fiber
network across the country to connect all 180 provinces over 22 states.
Telecom operators face high costs due to rough and undeveloped terrain
occupied predominately by low-income households, with large geographic
regions having very low user and device density.

Peru's mobile broadband penetration rate is also low; about a quarter of
the population has no mobile phone at all, while urban elites often use
multiple phones and SIM cards. As of 2010, a second-generation (2G)
mobile network covers 95 percent of Peru while a third-generation (3G)
mobile network covers 65 percent. Uncovered areas mostly belong to the
Peruvian Amazon. Compared to 30 percent of urban households who have
Internet access, only 1 percent of rural households have access.
Majority of the connections are in the city of Lima and other coastal
cities/towns. Satellite covers some of Peru's mountainous regions.

The government has taken some initiatives to help connect more people to
the Internet. The Amazon Integration Project auctioned the license to
provide broadband coverage to 70 rural communities in the northern
Amazonian region of Peru. An initiative called NapoNet, a collaborative
effort between partners in the University of Colorado and the Peruvian
state of Loreto brings services for health, education, and commerce to
indigenous communities along the middle and upper Napo Rivers of the
Maynas Province of the Loreto Region of Peru in the Peruvian Amazon.

Project Description
===================

In its early pilot projects, The Hispano-American Health Link Foundation
(EHAS) deployed access for public health establishments using mixed
fiber-wireless backhaul, unlicensed spectrum and Wi-Fi for Long
Distances (WiLD) to provide affordable communications services for
isolated health posts to connect to urban medical centers.

In recent years, TUCAN3G, one of EHAS's initiatives in the Napo River
basin in the Peruvian Amazon, has begun partnering with telecom
companies to enhance the sustainability of its networks. TUCAN3G seeks
to deploy 3G access points connected to the existing WiLD network in
order to provide affordable communications services for widespread
community use. The construction of the Napo network is shifting EHAS's
emphasis from providing access to regional government outposts to
connecting entire communities.

The project facilitates relationships between large mobile service
providers and smaller regional ones, in order to sustain Internet access
within these communities. The project seeks to incentivize the continued
participation of telecom corporations that have ignored these sparsely
populated, low-income areas. TUCAN3G aims to make the rural network a
worthwhile interest for urban-centric corporate profitability by
expanding the rural user base.

TUCAN3G started expanding to all the communities of the Napo river in
2016 with support from the Development Bank of Latin America. This new
phase is known as the Napo project.

Progress and Results
====================

The TUCAN3G project seeks to improve the healthcare of rural Latin
Americans through greater access to telecommunication technologies. The
project has not been deployed long enough in the Napo River region to
have yet yielded definitive data. Although data is still forthcoming for
the Napo network, a similar project in Guatemala may provide insight,
where telemedicine had a positive impact on community health and
maternal mortality.

Napo network's deployment has yielded some positive results in helping
maintain cultural roots, and preserved long-distance familial
relationships. For the first time, users can communicate with family
members who have left the village to live and work in cities in Peru or
other countries. Villagers are able to connect with loved ones despite
geographic and economic limitations. Anecdotally, mobile coverage has
also helped improve villagers' economic resources, with some users
connecting with vendors in larger towns or cities to sell their crops
and other goods.

Challenges
==========

**High deployment costs ­--** Major providers have little interest in
investing in or maintaining the network, as their profit is
insignificant while deployment costs are exorbitantly high. TUCAN3G is
attempting to overcome this challenge by partnering with smaller
regional backhaul providers to connect these communities to the larger
core network.

**Low capacity for maintenance --** Access to regular maintenance is
somewhat limited as these communities are very isolated. Researchers
more often than not rely on local inhabitants to survey and maintain
basic infrastructural elements.

**Challenging terrain --** The geography in this region dramatically
affects infrastructure costs. A tower in low-lying areas like a jungle
river basin can cost up to US\$ 17,000 more to build to a sufficient
height than a tower in a mountainous area.

EHAS'S Suggestions for Future Projects
======================================

**Community involvement is key --** The project team believes that,
given the tools for communication and outreach, a previously unconnected
and isolated community can make quick and effective use of provided
resources.

**Telecommunications attracts other resources --** According to EHAS,
final-year medical students on regional assignments prefer isolated
jungle communities with mobile coverage to Andean regions with developed
roads but no mobile or Internet access. Thus, mobile network coverage
can attract other resources.
