Executive Summary 
==================

The Virginia TV White Space (TVWS) Pilot Project, the largest of its
kind in the United States, delivers critical at-home Wi-Fi access and
educational content to K-12 students in Charlotte and Halifax counties
in Virginia. In May 2017, the Mid-Atlantic Broadband Communities
Corporation (MBC) and Microsoft, with support from the Virginia Tobacco
Region Revitalization Commission, launched an innovative "homework
network" to deliver broadband Internet access at home to thousands of
students in southern Virginia at no cost to their families. Partnering
with local school districts, the program is designed to serve the 50
percent of students in Charlotte and Halifax counties who currently lack
broadband access at home. MBC deploys Adaptrum's high-power TVWS
base-stations at existing school and tower locations along with ACRS2.0
client radios at student's homes. This services students with a filtered
selection of educational content that mirrors school curricula and
enables at-home learning and educational advancement. Currently, the
project is providing coverage to approximately 200 homes across the two
counties, and paid service options subsidize this free service to
students. As it is a pilot project, it plans to expand to other counties
in Virginia pending its ability to secure additional funding.

Context
=======

The U.S. is one of the countries with a high amount of Internet users.
While there is not as much variation in terms of Internet adoption
between genders, the disparity between urban and rural users has long
existed. Additionally, demographic groups with higher [levels of
education](https://www.statista.com/statistics/327138/internet-penetration-usa-education/)
and
[income](https://www.statista.com/statistics/327146/internet-penetration-usa-income/)
are more likely to go online than other groups. According to the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the
persistence of he urban-rural divide, even with the increasing
availability of smartphones and social media, suggests that the barriers
for Internet adoption in rural areas are complex. When lower education
and household income are coupled with rural location, the disadvantages
of accessing the Internet worsens.

In 2015, 78.2 percent of households in the eastern coastal U.S. state of
Virginia accessed the Internet through a broadband subscription. Yet, a
2016 Virginia Chamber of Commerce study found only 55 percent of homes
had access to high-speed broadband in rural areas. The national
broadband map recently created by the NTIA showed that Virginia ranked
40^th^ in terms of the percentage of residents in proximity to access
points with broadband speeds of 3 megabits per second (Mbps) or greater,
down from 37^th^ in 2013. There have been some initiatives, however,
both by local institutions like MBC and technology companies like
Microsoft via its Affordable Access Initiative -- which aims to support,
grow, and scale innovative businesses that are developing technologies
such as TVWS to close the digital divide globally -- to extend coverage
in rural Virginia.

Project Description
===================

The project currently serves two counties in Virginia with free
educational content-filtered Internet access for the homes of K-12
students in Charlotte and Halifax. After evaluating and piloting various
equipment options, MBC selected Adaptrum's TVWS solution based both on
the performance and reliability of the TVWS network as well as
Adaptrum's focus on innovating to further improve coverage and speeds to
connected families. TVWS works by providing Internet access via unused
TV spectrum frequencies that exist between live TV channels. Leveraging
TVWS technology, the network wirelessly extends existing broadband from
local schools to students' homes. Using TVWS equipment from Adaptrum,
Internet access is delivered via base stations installed on towers at or
near fiber-connected schools along with client radios installed at
students' homes. TVWS technology is ideal for delivering broadband
service to areas such as rural southern Virginia, as it can cover large
geographic areas, even with the hilly terrain and dense tree cover of
the region. Additionally, the local Internet service provider B2X Online
is responsible for installing the network.

The project currently serves approximately 200 homes with
customer-provided equipment (CPE) via 16 broadcast sites, 14 of which
are currently operational. The tower locations are split evenly between
the two counties; all of the towers are owned by their respective
county, with the exception of one Halifax tower, which is owned by MBC.
The project utilizes existing broadcast structures in order to cut down
on cost and optimize service provision.

The content available for access through the project is filtered to
reflect only those sites that teachers are using at school, enabling
students to continue their schoolwork from home. The service is provided
free-of-charge, but some qualifying households decline it anyway in
favor of unfiltered pay service that allows wider access to the Internet
and other content. The free service is supported in part by a paid
service model consisting of two paid subscriptions, an Internet light
package (US\$ 9.99 per month) and full package (US\$ 34.99 per month).
Other services are available ranging from US\$ 30 to US\$ 70.

Progress and Results
====================

The network has been successfully piloted in 100 households across both
counties, and aims to reach more than 3,000 students in 1,000 homes by
the end of 2017. Students have free access to their schools' online
networks where assignments and education resources are posted, extending
their learning time beyond the school day. To extend coverage to the
vast majority of the students, the project is focused around central
locations, partnering with the schools the students attend to mirror
their educational content online at home. MBC and Microsoft work with
Charlotte and Halifax County Public Schools to place the TVWS equipment
on the vertical assets already in place at many of the school locations.
A few additional towers have been constructed to cover populations where
a tower was not available, and in one location, a local water tower is
being used to broadcast the signal. Radios are mounted on each of the
towers located throughout the counties; these radios are used to
broadcast signal to individual student homes. To date, seven towers have
been equipped with radios and are providing service. The antenna and CPE
are wired to a router inside the home, which provides a Wi-Fi signal
that can be used by any device that is equipped with Wi-Fi capabilities
such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

The first phase of the program was launched in two counties, in
partnership with Halifax and Charlotte County public school districts,
which both have a general lack of widespread affordable broadband
options. The first phase of the network was comprised of 14 sites, each
with typically three sectors using Adaptrum High Power Base Station
radios. Providing long-range, none-line-of-sight coverage from school
and tower locations, the network has the capacity to reach more than
1,000 homes, which will receive Internet using Adaptrum's ACRS2.0 client
radios.

Following the success and positive impact of the initial phase, MBC
plans to expand the TVWS network with Adaptrum equipment to surrounding
counties. The expansion of the service includes and is in part supported
by a service option where MBC will sell commodity-based Internet for
students and their families set up by third-party provider partners. The
paid option offers full web access, not restricted solely to educational
content.

Challenges
==========

**Population Density --** The rural populations, hilly terrain, and an
abundance of trees make Virginia a difficult region to supply with
Internet connectivity. Since potential users tend to live far apart from
one another, selecting centralized broadcast locations that can reach
more than one household at a time is a challenge. Current sites have
been selected to optimize service to the most people most directly, but
this leaves out many of the most in need of service.

Virgina TVWS' Suggestions for Future Projects
=============================================

**Proper planning on tower selection can help increase user base --**
The project is able to optimize its user base through proper planning to
select sites with relatively higher population density so that the
broadcast reaches as many people as possible.

**Pre-existing infrastructure can be utilized in new ways --** While the
concept of TVWS is itself already premised on making better use of
services and information and communications technology (ICT)
infrastructure that already exist, this project benefits further by
broadcasting service from towers that are county-owned and already
present at schools whose students it aimed to serve at home.

**Multiple messages in multiple modalities are key to reach all
potential users --** The schools whose students were the target users
acted as a key player in distributing information. Materials must convey
the capability of the system as clearly and concisely as possible.
Multiple messages in multiple modalities have potential to address these
issues and reach all potential users. This project first used a long
flyer sent to each home, then shorter prepaid return mailer postcards,
and finally a very concise door hanger. The door hanger proved most
successful because it was tangible and demonstrated that a project
representative, not just a mail delivery person, had been to the site,
lending credibility to the enterprise.
