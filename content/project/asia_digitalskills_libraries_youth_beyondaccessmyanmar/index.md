Executive Summary 
==================

Beyond Access is a development initiative that focuses on strengthening
the social power of public and community libraries around the world. By
drawing on libraries' pre-existing institutional and infrastructural
utilities, Beyond Access is able to introduce long-term programs that
use technology to meet the needs of the different communities it serves.
Managed by the global nonprofit organization IREX and funded by the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation, Beyond Access works with civil and state
partners to transform libraries into sustainable public technology hubs.
The initiative flexibly implements library programs in nine different
countries along three different axes of focus: digital literacy and
inclusion, financial inclusion and economic opportunity, and community
solutions to improving literacy.

Context 
=======

At 26 percent, Myanmar has the lowest Internet penetration in Southeast
Asia, but experienced 97 percent growth within one year, according to
Internet in Myanmar. Since media censorship was abolished in 2012 and
the telecommunications monopoly was dissolved in 2014, there has been a
boost in mobile phone penetration and Internet usage. Smartphone use
totaled 80 percent in 2017, as reported by Digital in Asia. Most
Internet users come from Myanmar's two biggest cities: Yangon and
Mandalay. Although Internet is quite widespread in the country, the
speed is very slow, especially in rural areas. Additionally, despite the
rate of mobile phone penetration, the digital literacy rate in Myanmar
is quite low.

As in many other developing countries, one of the most pressing digital
divides in Myanmar is between men and women. Women are 28 percent less
likely to own a mobile phone than men; they also have much less access
to computers and the Internet due to gender norms and social stigma,
according to an IREX report. As a result, they have limited awareness of
digital literacy benefits and reduced digital skills to approach more
job opportunities. These barriers intensify for women of lower income,
living in rural areas, and in ethnic states lagging behind in
infrastructure and literacy rates.

Data shows that libraries are widespread throughout developing
countries, yet are undervalued by social development projects. In
Myanmar, there are 55,755 registered public libraries, but only 4,868
are considered active, many of which located in rural areas, according
to a study by The Asia Foundation. There is also a system of mobile
libraries available. People can visit libraries to read and borrow books
and periodicals, while some use them as meeting places and community
centers. Some can also access the Internet if they go to large, urban
libraries. The quality of libraries, however, varies with respect to the
availability of new books and materials, basic infrastructure (e.g.,
electricity, restrooms, etc.), and other resources, often at the
disadvantage of those in rural areas.

Project Description 
===================

Beyond Access has been active in Myanmar since 2014. They partner
closely with a local nonprofit organization, the Myanmar Book Aid
Preservation Foundation, to develop curricula and training programs in
digital literacy for local libraries. With a network of more than 100
libraries across the country, Beyond Access seeks to boost access to
technology in a number of different communities. A partnership with
Ooredeoo, a major telecommunications company in Asia, provides tablets,
routers, and Internet access for the libraries, which are used to
facilitate a number of different community programs. Training is
provided to librarians to provide services and outreach to meet diverse
needs within the community.

In Myanmar, digital skills are unequally skewed between genders, largely
due to public access computing being restricted to male-only spaces such
as cafés. As a result, they launched a major project called Tech Age
Girls, which serves to target the digital divide along gendered lines.
This program, founded in 2008 and operating in eight different
countries, provides digital skills training, peer networking, and
mentorship to young women. Connectivity in public libraries already
contributes significantly to providing opportunities for women and girls
to learn information and communications technology (ICT) skills, but
some cultural interventions are also required. To this end, Tech Age
Girls supplements this availability with programs in leadership and
empowerment for teenage girls.

Progress and Results 
====================

Research showed that a year into the library program, 70 percent of
users were men and boys. In order to increase participation by women,
Beyond Access launched their Tech Age Girls initiative, where 100 girls
have been connected to ICT and leadership training. They will continue
to support new cohorts as the program continues, expanding their work
into community service projects.

It is not only library users who have been positively impacted, but also
librarians themselves are able to more quickly and inexpensively
communicate with government ministries and funders. The Internet and
devices have made the task of composing progress reports to the
government cheap and easy. With knowledge and access to online
resources, librarians have also become effective expediters between
communities and the government, helping patrons access e-government
services.

Challenges {#challenges .ListParagraph}
==========

**Rapid government turnover --** The value of libraries rests in large
part on their readymade integration in government funding structures.
Political instability in developing countries, however, can pose
challenges to the continuity of these programs as funding priorities may
shift away from supporting community resources, social cohesion, and
education.

**Community resistance -** Not all librarians are amenable to the notion
that libraries should prioritize more than just books. It can sometimes
be challenging to garner the support of library administrators for the
inclusion of ICTs and digital literacy.

Beyond Access' Suggestions for Future Projects 
==============================================

**Global partnerships with local organisations helps --** IREX does not
have a physical presence in any of the countries where they work, so it
is imperative that they partner with local organizations. This is not
only a logistical necessity; Beyond Access' funding policy is to
contribute no more than 50 percent of each program's total costs. This
local buy-in element of the initiative contributes to the strength of
each program's sustainability, and Beyond Access\' reports that their
partners almost always succeed in raising more than the required half of
the funds.

**Nationwide networks for information sharing can be a good community
gathering resource point** -- By networking libraries to one another,
Beyond Access facilitates peer support between librarians in widely
different areas of the country. Not only does this allow for knowledge
sharing, but it also creates efficacious systems of social cohesion and
care. For example, when floods displaced thousands of people in Myanmar,
librarians within the network marshaled their resources to help those in
relief camps or cut off from access to information. These modern library
services were also of help to government relief programs, providing
local information and communicating needs and numbers to federal aid
officials.
