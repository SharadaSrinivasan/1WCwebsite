Executive Summary  
==================

The National Computer Board of Mauritius was established in 1988 by the
National Computer Board Act to promote the development of information
and communication technologies (ICT) in Mauritius. It is a para-state
body administered by a board of directors and operates under the aegis
of the Ministry of Technology, Communication, and Innovation. Its goal
is to be a key enabler in transforming Mauritius into a Cyber island and
regional ICT hub. The project is working to reduce the digital divide
and promote connected communities by implementing 600 Wi-Fi hotspots
with 10 megabit per second (Mbps) Internet connection through
fiber-optics, set up in public places across Mauritius, as well as with
the introduction of 270 computer clubs across the country. The projects
are oriented toward providing universal access to ICTs to all segments
of the population.

Context 
=======

The government of Mauritius aspires to make the island a "cyber island"
by focusing on the development of its telecommunications sector. In
2016, the ICT sector contributed 5.7 percent of Mauritius's gross
domestic product (GDP), where it is expected to become the third pillar
of the island's economy. Moreover, according to the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), Mauritius ranked 73^rd^ out of 175
countries in the 2016 *ICT Development Index*, the highest among all
African nations.

The development of the ICT sector lies within the strategy to position
Mauritius as a platform for ICT-related business services delivery to
Africa, according to the Minister of Technology, Communication, and
Innovation. Many global companies have recognized the country as a
promising market and invested, such as Microsoft, Huawei, Accenture, and
Ceridian, among others. It also hosts the headquarters of the African
Network Information Center (AFRINIC) -- the regional registry for
Internet number resources serving the African Internet community.

A 2015 report by Frost & Sullivan identified Mauritius as the country
with the highest Networked Readiness Index in Southern Africa. In the
same report, however, Mauritius ranked low in infrastructure and digital
content (77^th^ out of 140 countries). The challenges identified for
Mauritius include the limited coverage of its fiber-optic network
(50,000 households out of 3 million in 2014), low penetration rate, slow
Internet speed, and the low workforce impact (only 19,000 employments in
the sector).

Project Description
===================

The National Computer Board’s projects include free Wi-Fi hotspots, mobile Internet access stations (Cyber Caravans), and training in different kinds and levels of digital literacy. The NCB has been successful in spreading awareness of and facility with technology. 

**Wi-Fi hotspots** – Currently, the country hosts 350 free Wi-Fi hotspots by Mauritius Telecom, and have announced plans to introduce 250 more hotspots by 2019.
**The Cyber Caravan project** – The goals of the project are to raise the level of knowledge about ICTs and to make Internet and computer access available to everyone in the community. There are currently three Cyber Caravans – equipped with 10, 21, & 21 personal computers (PCs), respectively, and broadband Internet connection – operating across the island. They travel to remote areas of the island and train different segments of the community over seven days, allowing residents to access the Internet and training programs with the devices and connectivity on board. As of October 2017, more than 250,000 people have been trained. 
**ICT training programs**  - The National Computer Board offers various educational programs including educational video programs on Microsoft Office available to download on their website. 
**Digital youth engagement program** – In an attempt to promote interest for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among young learners, the NCB will offer introductory courses on Coding for fourth- and fifth-grade students in primary schools with the support of the Ministry of Education, Human Resources, Tertiary Education, and Scientific Research. The students will be provided with a 15-hour-long training course with PCs, laptops, Raspberry Pis, and tablets in the Cyber Caravans, which will scale to various primary schools around the island. Since 2017, the NCB has trained 1,611 youth on coding techniques, and estimates to reach 2,000 primary school students staring in 2018. In addition, 769 young people have been introduced to Scratch, a visual programming language developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Media Lab, to help them learn creative thinking and systematic reasoning skills. Furthermore, the NCB is also providing two-hour-long coding courses on code.org for youth in the Cyber Caravans.
**Community empowerment program** – Under this ongoing program, which began in 2009, the NCB has set up computer clubs, learning corners, and public Internet access points. With sponsorship by Microsoft and the Mauritius Telecom Foundation, 270 Computer Clubs with three PCs and free Internet access have been established in various locations including youth centers, women centers, community centers, social welfare centers, daycare centers, and city halls and municipal buildings. In addition, public Internet access points are available in the 100 post offices in Mauritius & Rodrigues.
**ICT literacy training for women** – ICT literacy training has been offered for women in Cyber Caravans, five hours per day over the course of a nine-day period. After completing the program, a certificate of attendance is issued for participants.

Progress and Results 
====================

The Mauritius Government Budget for 2016/2017 announced 250 additional
free Wi-Fi Hotspots will be set up around the island in major public
areas, such as traffic centers, hospitals, municipalities and district
councils, to reduce the digital divide and promote connected
communities. Similarly, the previous budget catered for 350 locations in
Mauritius to be equipped with Wi-Fi. Thus, the new budget measures will
increase the total number of Wi-Fi hotspots in Mauritius to 600 in
total.

The 350 Wi-Fi hotspots have been set up in community centers, social
welfare centers, women centers, youth centers, municipality, district
councils, schools, and public Internet access points (PIAPs). These
locations are frequently visited by the public and offer the opportunity
of the public to be connected freely to the Internet through a
smartphone or laptop, in particular via its "bring-your-own-device"
strategy.

The additional 250 locations have also been selected on the basis of
promoting connected communities in public areas. The locations include
hospitals, community hospitals, medical clinics, local area health
centers, community health centers, major public/tourist attractions,
public beaches, cultural heritage spots, markets, traffic centers,
municipal complexes, stadiums, gymnasiums, and museums.

The Wi-Fi radius coverage extends to 200-250 meters in the air, and 50
users can be accommodated simultaneously. The user should have a mobile
phone (any operator) to send a Short Message Service (SMS) request for a
PIN code to access to the platform. Content filtering is provided by the
service provider, which manages the project remotely through its 24-hour
hotline service.

The access points are placed in suitable positions for maximum coverage.
MT provided the cable connections between routers to the various access
points, while the owners of the locations have had to ensure reliable
and safe access to electricity and a back-up power source, the security
of the equipment being provided, and to keep the equipment powered on,
once installed.

While Wi-Fi access is being promoted through the bring-your-own-device
system, the needs of people who do not possess a smartphone or a laptop
have also been concurrently addressed. This is critical since all
segments of the population must have access to ICTs to achieve the
government's vision. As part of its mission to empower people, the NCB
implemented the Community Empowerment Program (CEP). The CEP aims to
enable the creation and sharing of information and knowledge for
community development. A major component of the CEP began in 2009 when
270 computer clubs were established in collaboration with Microsoft and
the Mauritius Telecom Foundation to provide free access to ICT tools and
broadband Internet. The computer clubs contribute to the development of
Mauritius by facilitating the democratization of ICTs in order to
contribute in the alleviation of poverty, and bridge the digital divide
through democratized access for the whole community.

Computer clubs provide ICT infrastructure for those who cannot afford a
computer as well as large families that own a personal computer (PC) but
require additional capacity. Each computer club has been equipped with
around three PCs and free Internet access. Computer clubs were
established across the island in 23 youth centers, 15 women's centers,
128 community centers, 53 social welfare centers, 20 daycare centers and
31 nongovernmental organizations, municipal councils, and/or village
halls. The 270 computer clubs set up around the island have had a
positive impact on the community as well. About 1,500,000 registrations,
including recurrent users, have benefited from the services provided,
and there is continuously growing demand by students, unemployed
individuals, stay-at-home parents, and senior citizens.

E-services are a large component of the project too. A total of 80
services are available, and 90 percent of tax services are now possible
to complete online -- as compared to none 10-15 years ago.

The NCB has recently redefined its strategies to respond more
effectively to new national aspirations in view of multi-facetted
challenges emerging in the wake of globalization and threatening the
very resilience of the country\'s economy. Its core mission is to now
accelerate the transition of Mauritius into a regional ICT hub, and
ensure the swift realization of government\'s objective to make of the
ICT sector a key pillar of the economy.

Challenges 
==========

**Coordination challenges --** The main challenge in implementing such a
project has been to transform the government's various public-private
partnerships into a concerted effort for community development and
empowerment. For example, private companies wished to publicize their
involvement and contributions, but government regulations prohibit the
advertisement of private sector businesses.

**Lack of skilled manpower** -- They are freelancers and are not
well-compensated. As a result, there is a high turnover; so, maintaining
consistency has been difficult.

NCB's Suggestions for Future Projects 
=====================================

**Sustainability through simplicity --** The project's simple model
makes it easier to replicate in any other country where partnership
among different stakeholders is required and a proper project
implementation is required.

**User feedback mechanisms --** The project aims to revolutionize the way
Mauritians communicate, with each other, and hotlines are available for
users to report any connectivity issues that may impede this. Most
importantly, these ICT services are seen as key building blocks for
Mauritius' digital modernization, and are helping to create a digitally
empowered nation that transcends social and economic barriers.

**Collaboration with civil services --** Their experience suggests that
working with dedicated teams and support from the government in
collaboration with the various ministries is important for the smooth
implementation of new ICT services in a constantly evolving modern
economy.

**Community development --** A large part of the project's success is
thanks to the project team's attention to community development. Its
training programs and accessible presence in public, community spaces
have successfully made citizens aware of the value and possibility of
ICTs, incentivizing them to invest in technology, and its future in the
country.
