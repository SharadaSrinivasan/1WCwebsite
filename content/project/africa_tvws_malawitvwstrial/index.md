Executive Summary 
==================

The University of Malawi, in partnership with the Malawi Communications
Regulatory Authority (MACRA) and the International Centre for
Theoretical Physics launched a TV white spaces pilot in the university
town of Zomba in southern Malawi in 2013. The project has connected
different institutions until now, including a school, a hospital, an
airport and a research facility. In 2015, the project expanded to
connect a secondary school at Mulanje where students can now connect to
the Internet via their computer lab.

Context
=======

Malawi, a landlocked country with high prevalence of poverty, has very
low access to the Internet. As of 2014, Internet penetration stood at 6
percent, with fixed broadband subscriptions reaching only 0.05 percent
of the population in the country. The country's ICT backbone has not
been regionally integrated, and due to its landlocked nature, its
connection to international fiber runs through Mozambique, Zambia, South
Africa, and Tanzania through the SEACOM and EASSy networks.

Project Description
===================

The Malawi TVWS project has a single base station and three client
stations arranged in a star topology. It has connected a school, a
hospital, an airport and a research facility. The 2013 pilot was a
partnership between the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority,
International Center for Theoretical Physics, and the physics department
of the Chancellor College at the University of Malawi. The network
included four sites, and set the record for the longest operational TV
White Spaces link, with two of those sites being 20 kilometers apart.
Low cost hardware components as well as software for scanning the
spectrum and for transmitting signals are now being developed at the
computer lab in the University of Malawi. Unused TV white spaces are
less costly than Wi-Fi in rural areas, as for the same amount of power,
a TV white space signal can cover a wider area than a high frequency
Wi-Fi signal, which reduces the number of base stations and antennas
needed to set up the network.

The Mulanje Secondary School, connected in 2015, has a new computer lab
that enables students to access the Internet to do homework and learn
from online resources.

Progress and Results
====================

The project has already benefited several stakeholders in Malawi.
Researchers at the Pirimiti Community Hospital are now able to upload
real-time X-ray images and access online resources. Remote specialists
are now able to use the link to advise local staff based on this data,
improving patient outcomes. Further, geological data in real time is
being transmitted to seismologists through the link, which has improved
Malawi's disaster response. Students at the local school can now stream
educational videos and use services such as Skype for communication. The
success of these stories has led to consultations on regulations of TV
White Spaces.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of affordable access --** In Malawi, mobile broadband costs more
than US\$ 14 per 4 GB of data per month, which makes Internet access out
of the reach of most Malawians, as it is nearly 50 percent of the
average per capita income, much higher than the 5 percent benchmark set
by the ITU.

**Limited and irregular electricity access --** Less than 9 percent of
the country has access to electricity, with the grid concentrated in
urban centers and only reaching a mere 1 percent of rural households.

**Low levels of traditional literacy --** A low literacy rate of 64
percent and a significant digital gender divide also hinders access to
ICTs in Malawi.

Malawi TVWS Project's Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================================

**Successful TVWS deployments by leveraging the right partnerships can
lead to policy and regulatory attention** \-- Using TV White Spaces
shows promise as a low-cost alternative to provide the benefits of
connectivity in areas where a fiber backbone is too expensive to deploy.
The Malawi telecommunications regulator took note of the trial, and
proceeded to create a regulatory framework for TVWS use in the country.
