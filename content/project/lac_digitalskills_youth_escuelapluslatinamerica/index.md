Executive Summary 
==================

Escuela+ is a program that uses satellite technology and solar-powered
infrastructure on the ground combined with innovative educational
programming to connect rural schools in Latin America that do not have
any Internet access to high quality educational content. The program,
active since 2007, has reached over 1 million students, 65,000 teachers,
and 6,800 schools in eight countries in Latin America including
Colombia, Chile, Brazil and Argentina. It is supported by a broad
coalition of organizations, including AT&T, DirecTV, National
Geographic, Discovery and Fundacion Torneos.

Context
=======

In rural areas, the educational system in most countries in Latin
America suffers from pockets of limited coverage with incomplete access
to quality education. This led to high repetition and dropout rates.
Moreover, because they were in areas with low population, rural schools
tended to be low priority in terms of the allocation of resources. This
is particularly true in countries like Colombia, Peru and Brazil, where
millions of rural schools suffer from a lack of resources.

Project Description
===================

ESCUELA+ uses last mile satellite connectivity to provide educational
content from high quality sources such as the Discovery channel and
National Geographic, as well as the National Television Council's
educational content, to students in rural schools. The satellite
connectivity provides access to this programming in any school with TV
and electrical power. Where such electrical power was not easily
accessible, solar-powered alternatives are being deployed to make
streamed educational content easily available to school-going children
in rural areas, as part of ESCUELA+ Solar initiative. DirecTV's DVR
recording facility allows teachers to manage content and record over 100
hours of programming, and use this content as part of a pedagogy that
integrates interactive and integrated learning supplemented by online
information.

Teachers are trained in the use of ESCUELA+ audio/visual technology, as
well as the *Discovery en la ESCUELA* pedagogy. Using media, technology
and digital satellite television, learning processes are tailored to
incorporate an innovative teaching methodology in these schools.

Progress and Results
====================

Since 2007, ESCUELA+ has reached over 16 million alum in Argentina,
along with 2 million students, 65,000 teachers, and 8500 schools in
eight countries. Over 80% of ESCUELA+ schools are in underserved areas.
Independent evaluation studies conducted by the University of Chile
Department of Education and by the Faculty of Social Sciences in two
waves concluded that students receiving education supplemented by
ESCUELA+ methodology performed consistently better than a control group.
ESCUELA+ students registered higher performance scores analyzed by
year-on-year performance, grade level and subject matter. Further, in
2016, ESCUELA+ launched a channel to support teacher training content
and collaborative content from ministries of partner countries.

Challenges
==========

**Geographical barriers to connecting remote areas---** In most rural
areas in Latin America, it is geographically unviable to connect rural
schools to adequate infrastructure via fiber. A lot of the schools also
lack consistent access to power and other allied infrastructure.

**Unavailability of local language educational content:** Local language
educational content is comparatively scarce and difficult to access for
schools in rural areas. ESCUELA+ is scaling this challenge by
collaborating with education ministries in partner countries to create
tailor-made content that can be streamed to target schools

ESCUELA+'s Suggestions for Future Projects
==========================================

**Educational videos and streamed content through satellite links can
address educational inclusion goals in rural areas, improving
educational outcomes among the population---** ESCUELA+ leverages the
power of satellite connectivity and original content to provide access
to highly relevant and educational materials to otherwise marginalized
populations. Combining innovative technological deployment with adequate
demand-side drivers such as local content, provides a viable model for
improving take-up.

**Collaboration with public and private partners can help create
relevant educational content---** ESCUELA+ collaborates with partners in
participating ministries of education -- Colombia, Ecuador and Chile, to
create content not only for students but also for teacher training
purposes. This partnership model is highly influential in creating the
right content that is context-specific, and can aid in learning of
target students.
