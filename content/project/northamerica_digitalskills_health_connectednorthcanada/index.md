Executive Summary 
==================

The Connected North initiative aims to augment educational and
healthcare services to youth in remote indigenous communities in
Northern Canada. It deploys Cisco's Telepresence technology (MX 300 G2)
to offer real-time, live interactive experiences with experts and
students in other classrooms around Canada. The project has grown from a
single pilot location in 2014 to implementation in 30 schools. Within
five years, Connected North expects to deploy telepresence units in 100
schools. Connected North's success is indicative of the utility of
immersive, interactive Internet learning for students in remote regions
to combat endemic local social issues such as a low graduation rate of
approximately 20 percent, and the highest global per capita suicide rate
among youth. The project's expansion, while desperately needed, is
curtailed by cost and funding concerns.

Context
============

The Nunavut territory is Canada's northernmost territory, almost
exclusively made up of about 37,000 indigenous people. Nunavut is a
conglomeration of 25 communities without roads between them that stretch
across one-fifth of Canada's total landmass. Telecommunication services
in the region are nearly nonexistent, which further reinforces the
area's isolation. When available, Internet is costly and slow with
uplink speeds of around 1 Mbps.

Internet service providers (ISPs), advocates, and the territory's
government agree that greater investments in the region's infrastructure
are required to better link it with the south. Currently, the government
provides connectivity to the region as the few private offerings are
unaffordable to Nunavat's citizens. Due to the lack of
telecommunications infrastructure, digital literacy and adoption are low
in Nunavut as well.

Project Description
===================

Connected North is an immersive, digital education, and mental health
and wellness network that provides customized services and real-time
experiences to students in remote Indigenous communities. Launched as a
pilot in a single school in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, the
project has expanded since 2013. Using Cisco TelePresence technology,
Connected North leverages real-time, high-definition, two-way video to
connect students to experts in K-12 classrooms.

There are five overarching content areas that Connected North focuses
on: virtual fieldtrips, mentoring, experts on demand in a vast array of
subject areas, classroom cultural exchanges (between indigenous and
non-indigenous student populations and among indigenous classrooms), and
programming called "Future Pathways," which aims to help students attend
post-secondary institutions as well as make them aware of career paths
that are available to them. 90 percent of the content is indigenous
themed. Connected North staffers work hand-in-hand with teachers for
content offerings, and work to reinforce indigenous cultural educational
styles, such as the emphasis on collaborative learning in Inuit schools.

In smaller schools, telepresence setups are put in common areas so all
classes may use them as needed. In larger schools, each intermediate
classroom (6^th^, 7^th^, and 8^th^ grades) has a unit. Cisco sells these
units for CA\$ 30,000 (US\$ 23,611.82), however, they offer a 70 percent
discount to Canadian school districts, bringing the cost down to
approximately CA\$ 9,000 (US\$ 7200). Due to the program's success,
Cisco spun-off Connected North to be managed and led by a charity
partner, TakingITGlobal. Together with Cisco, the team built an
ecosystem of more than 50 funding partners including federal,
provincial, and territorial governments, private sector lenders, private
foundations, and individual donors.

The impetus and continued support for Connected North comes from two
tragic statistics of Canadian indigenous youth: the dropout rate is
approximately 80 percent, and these communities have the highest rates
of youth suicide per capita in the world. Combatting these systemic
problems required more than just educational resources. Connected North
provides students with access to remote mental health and wellness
professionals that are otherwise inaccessible. The continued success and
expansion of the Connected North project is shows feasibility of
technological interventions to ameliorate systemic social issues in
remote communities. While it may not be possible to provide experts and
healthcare providers to remote populations physically, Cisco's
telepresence units help bridge coverage gaps.

Progress and Results
====================

Connected North began in 2013 with a single pilot school. As of 2017,
there are currently 32 schools with 4 more being built. A five-year
projected estimate sees more than 100 schools being serviced within the
next five years. Connected North partners only with those communities
who request the service, and so many school districts have displayed
interest that there is currently a waiting list. In Nunavut, the
territory where the pilot school was located, the government asked
Connected North to rollout the service in all of its 43 schools, which
they will subsidize as a budget line item. Other locations where
telepresence units are in-use include the Northwest and Yukon
Territories, and the province of Ontario.

Since its inception, Connected North has facilitated more than 750
real-time sessions for nearly 3,000 indigenous students. Despite
starting challenges, schools averaged three-to-four sessions a week by
2017. In practice, this affords Connected North almost an hour a day in
the classroom, which teachers report as a net positive on student
engagement and success.

Connected North has continually relied on feedback from students and
teachers in schools with the telepresence units, and the response has
been uniformly positive. In the pilot deployment, 81 percent of students
reported that they learned more in a telepresence session than in their
traditional classroom coursework. In addition, students found
telepresence sessions made science more interesting (83 percent) and
more enjoyable (89 percent). Later assessments echoed this positive
impact on student interest level. Evaluations of the 2015-2016 academic
year, for instance, found that 60 percent of students found an aspect of
the sessions interesting and wanted to learn more. Connected North's
intervention has also positively impacted individual students' views on
their future. Sixty-four percent of students reported believing they
could be successful in the future, and 62 percent reported being excited
about their futures.

The telepresence units also work to empower teachers, along with the
students. Connected North works in synchronization with teachers to
provide the materials that are most relevant to the educators'
lesson-plans. Also, the organization offers a considerable amount of
professional development opportunity for faculty.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of adequate funding --** The aims and technologies that guide the
Connected North project are easily scalable. Yet, the largest impediment
to rolling out telepresence units in more school districts is costly.
Cisco has contributed more than US\$ 5 million, and while donors and
governmental entities have been generous, yet funding still falls short
of providing units to all the schools who desire them.

Connected North's Suggestions for Future Projects
=================================================

**Considering cultural specificities is important --** The Connected
North initiative pays a lot of attention to indigenous cultural
specificities. The way in which telepresence units function is congruent
with Inuit pedagogies about collaborative learning and mixed-media
lessons. In the project's present incarnation, local curricula guide the
type of content that Connected North makes available. Finally, students
have been found to be particularly interested in sharing their own
culture and learning about geographically diverse peers' cultures, and
telepresence units are particularly suited to facilitate this.
