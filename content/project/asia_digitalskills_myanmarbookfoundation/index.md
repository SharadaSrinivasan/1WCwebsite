Executive Summary 
==================

The Myanmar Book Aid and Preservation Foundation (MBAPF) is a nonprofit
organization that was established in 2008 following the high death toll
and widespread destruction of Cyclone Nargis. To rebuild communities,
the foundation focused its efforts on modernizing underserved
populations through the introduction of information and communications
technologies (ICTs) in libraries around the country. Through
partnerships with global charities, individual donors, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and United States-based universities, MBAPF
provides Internet access, devices, software, and locally tailored
training through a number of different projects that target different
segments of Myanmar's population.

Context
==========

Most Internet users are located in Myanmar's two biggest cities, Yangon
and Mandalay, where the penetration is highest. The rate of smartphone
use is almost 80 percent in 2017. The main medium for Internet access is
still mobile phones, but laptop use is on the rise. Internet speeds,
however, are very slow, especially in rural areas. Despite the fast rate
of mobile phone penetration, digital literacy and awareness in Myanmar
is quite low, and even nonexistent in some rural areas.

Libraries are key institutions that promote digital literacy. In
Myanmar, there are 55,755 registered public libraries, but only 4,868
are considered active. Moreover, many of the libraries are located in
rural areas, according to the Asia Foundation. There is also a system of
mobile libraries in Myanmar. Besides the basic services offered,
visitors can also access the Internet if they go to large, urban
libraries. The quality of libraries, however, varies. The availability
of new books and materials, basic infrastructure (e.g., electricity,
bathrooms, etc.), among others, are different from one library to
another and often disadvantage those in rural areas.

Project Description
===================

In collaboration with Beyond Access, a consortium of 11 organizations,
MBAPF aims to modernize public libraries of Myanmar since 2013 through
several programs. The first project, Beyond Access Myanmar, was launched
in November 2014 with the support of Ooredoo Myanmar and the Ministry of
Information. Ninety libraries were provided with Internet access, and
150 libraries were provided with tablets and laptops. In addition,
training on new library services, ICTs for librarians, and library
leadership programs have been conducted since 2014.

The second project, Mobile Information Literacy (MIL), was developed in
collaboration with TASCHA and the University of Washington in 2015.
Development consisted of adapting the university's own Digital
Information Literacy curriculum to the local needs of Myanmar, where
more than 80 percent of Internet users access the Internet via
smartphone. Initially, the project aimed only at training librarians in
digital literacy and ICT skills, and although MBF continues to be
library-based, it has expanded training programs as demand grows. Now,
it offers its curriculum to librarians, civil servants, civil society
groups, research firms, and students. The training program is being
monitored and evaluated by United Nations University (UNU). The
supporters of this project also include the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, Microsoft, Tableau, the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), and the Asia Foundation.

The third project known as Tech Age Girls Myanmar aims to close the
gender gap in digital literacy in Myanmar by providing ICT and soft
skills for girls between the ages of 16 and 20. In 2016, the foundation
selected 20 libraries that each hosted a cohort of five girls to receive
training. Their training includes not only competence in ICTs, but also
training in leadership skills and project management. This program
culminates with a meeting between these girls and female leaders of
Myanmar ­-- politicians, executives, entrepreneurs, etc. -- and with the
girls developing their own local community projects. The first group of
100 girls finished the nine-month program in 2017, and will begin to
serve as trainers in their local libraries.

Progress and Results
====================

The MIL program partnered with UNU researchers to develop methods to
monitor and evaluate the impact of the program. The program currently
uses two different impact assessment methods. The first is short-term
and survey-based that measures participants' skill-levels pre- and
post-implementation. Through this survey assessment, the program saw it
was able to improve skills by 15 to 30 percent. The second assessment
method is long-term and psychologically focused. It aims to analyze how
behaviors, mind-sets, and lifestyles are changed by the introduction of
ICTs in these communities. Evidence gathering and monitoring are ongoing
for this phase.

In additional post-deployment surveys, MIL rates the success of its
programs on individual libraries. Out of the 90 libraries in which they
initially deployed MIL, 30 are what the organization calls "gold
standard" libraries. This means that they have not only responded well
to deployment and training, but they have also successfully integrated
ICTs into their community and are seeking or implementing sustainable,
community-based solutions for their continuance.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of Funding --** Expansion is limited to the availability of
funds. Proceeding on a project-by-project basis, MBF trains library
staff and community participants as funds allow. This means that the
administration's attentions are largely consumed by constant funding
searches. It also means that they are not able to hire permanent
training staff.

**Lack of consistent electricity --** Power supply can be erratic in
certain regions. The emphasis on mobile informational literacy mitigates
in part the reliance on a continuous power supply.

MBAPF's Suggestions for Future Projects
=======================================

**Engaging communities to sustain projects is necessary --** Start-up
funds and grants are necessary for launching a countrywide ICT project.
These start-up funds serve to introduce communities to the value of an
unfamiliar resource: initial equipment costs, access, and training
provide first-hand testimony of the value ICTs bring to a community.
After these funds are efficaciously exhausted, it is important that the
community itself takes charge and develops a sustainable model to
continue and expand local ICT access.

**Addressing ICT gender gaps is important--** In Myanmar, the
availability of ICT access is often limited to spaces that are
socio-culturally off-limits to women, such as cyber cafés and teashops.
A key aspect of MBF's strategy to close the ICT gender gap is their
focus on the library as a public, mixed-gendered community space.
Projects looking to address ICT gender gaps mal benefit from taking into
account the cultural specificity of the discrepancy in order to
strategize its remedy.
