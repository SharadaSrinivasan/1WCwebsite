Executive Summary 
==================

The Internet Policy Observatory Pakistan (IPOP) is a think tank founded
in 2014 and based in Balochistan, Pakistan. It aims to foster
countrywide Internet connectivity with a focus on rural areas. IPOP
deploys 36 of what the organization refers to as "Internet houses."
These are rooms, often in local administration offices, which provide
communities with fiber and satellite Internet connectivity using donated
hardware that IPOP refurbishes. The Internet houses are staffed by
volunteers who also conduct digital literacy trainings. IPOP is an
example of an effective grassroots connectivity initiative, which has
faced considerable challenges from funding and governmental impediments.

Context
=======

Balochistan, Pakistan, is the largest of Pakistan's four provinces and
forms the southwest region of the country. According to a Pakistani
government census, Balochistan is split into about 76 percent and about
24 percent. The geography of the province is diverse with beaches to the
west, mountains to the north, and the remainder is plains, highlands,
and desert. The geography and rural environment along with major
security issues has resulted in unstable and relatively expensive
Internet and mobile services. According to Pak Voices, a nonprofit
project by Bytes for All Pakistan supported by Free Press Unlimited, 3G
and 4G mobile services are available. Coverage is poor, however, and
services are occasionally suspended by the government for security
concerns or technical issues related to the fiber optics causing
widespread issues for individuals as well as companies.

Internet penetration in Pakistan is at 14 percent and is limited by a
lack of resources, low literacy, electricity shortages, difficult
economic conditions, and cultural resistance. In Balochistan
specifically, lack of Internet access is primarily due to
underdevelopment and ongoing political and social conflict. As for
broadband, about 75 percent of tribal areas and 60 percent of
Balochistan does not have fiber optic cables as of 2013, according to
*Tigah Journal.* Internet costs are still relatively expensive for the
majority of people, particularly those in remote areas, such as
Balochistan.

Project Description
===================

The Internet Policy Observatory Pakistan (IPOP) is a think tank that
conducts research on ICT policy and regulation in Pakistan and informs
policy. IPOP also seeks to be a nexus point for researchers, activists,
and institutions for collaborative policy work.

In an effort to close the digital divide in rural communities in
Balochistan, Pakistan, IPOP provides hardware, trainings, and Internet
connectivity in the form of Internet houses. Local telecommunications
companies donate all of the hardware, and volunteer engineers refurbish
it for use in the Internet houses. Because of the unreliability and
unavailability of electricity, IPOP powers the stations with solar
panels. When an Internet house is first constructed, there is a trainer
on-site for a week. Afterward, a volunteer maintains the site and can
contact IPOP as needed for technical support or resources for
programming offered by the Internet house. In addition to providing
off-site support, IPOP visits each facility quarterly to make sure the
machines are secure and have up-to-date software.

Also, IPOP runs entry-level digital literacy trainings each quarter
focusing on both on hardware and software. Everyone who completes the
training is given an email address as well as outfitted with accounts on
social messaging apps and social media. These trainings and use of the
Internet houses are completely free to end users.

Progress and Results 
=====================

IPOP has successfully connected some of the underserviced population of
Balochistan, Pakistan. They currently maintain 36 Internet houses, 12
fiber, 24 satellite, all with satellite backup, with 15 more in the
pipeline. Over the last two years, IPOP has conducted 416 training
sessions. Because they are co-located with governmental administrative
offices, they offer some minimal e-governance support, such as
connecting online to submit forms for identification cards. IPOP is also
piloting Wi-Fi in two locations to help connect more women in the
province, as travel to the Internet houses is not always safe. IPOP has
also recruited female volunteers in some Internet houses to help bridge
the gender gap in Internet access.

An Internet house enables education and employment opportunities. One
young man from the region used to travel three hours each way to search
for jobs and educational opportunities at the Internet house. He was
able to apply and was accepted to a top university in the region. It
also enables ecommerce activities. IPOP notes that women were able to
market their handicrafts on Facebook, which has provided them with much
needed revenue.

IPOP has also allied with other campaigns and initiatives for the
betterment of the region and Pakistan as a whole. In addition, through
IPOP's Digital Security Capacity Building Initiative, the organization
makes policy recommendations on cybersecurity, cybercrime, data
protection, and e-governance.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding --** There is no government support for the
work IPOP is doing. In addition, they also met some resistance while
attempting to install the Internet houses at local administrative
offices. They also struggle with enticing international donors. IPOP is
also unable to keep up with the demand for Internet houses because they
do not have enough donated hardware.

**Lack of skilled manpower --** Balochistan lacks individuals with the
skills to setup technology needed for connectivity.

**Limited and irregular electricity access** -- Before IPOP was able to
use solar panels to power the Internet houses, the organization was
forced to rely on the electric grid that offered about two hours of
electricity a day.

**Lack of security** **--** IPOP ensures the cybersecurity of their
online houses with quarterly updates. Yet, real-world security concerns
are also problematic, as there is political strife in the region. Some
of the Internet houses are more than a day's drive from IPOP, and the
safety of personnel cannot always be guaranteed.

IPOP's Suggestions for Future Projects
======================================

**Digital divide solutions need to account for country specific
conditions --** One of the biggest strengths of IPOP is the flexibility
with which is overcomes the challenges it faces in bringing connectivity
to rural locations. This flexibility is necessary due to very specific
cultural and geographic realities that IPOP faces. Because other
countries may contend with dissimilar issues, the IPOP model may not be
as effective in other locales. Thus, it is useful to identify an area's
specific features that can impede connectivity and then find ways to
circumvent these hurdles.
