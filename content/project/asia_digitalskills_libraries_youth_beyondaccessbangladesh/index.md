Executive Summary 
==================

Beyond Access focuses on strengthening the social power of public and
community libraries around the world. The project began with the
recognition that libraries are widespread throughout developing
countries, but continue to be undervalued by social development
projects. By drawing on libraries' pre-existing institutional and
infrastructural utilities, Beyond Access introduces long-term programs
that use technology to meet the needs of the different communities it
serves. Managed by the global nonprofit organization IREX and funded by
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Beyond Access works with civil
and state partners such as Save the Children to transform libraries into
sustainable public information and communications technology (ICT) hubs.
The initiative implements library programs in nine different countries
along three different axes of focus: digital literacy and inclusion,
financial inclusion and economic opportunity, and community-led literacy
solutions.

Context
=======

In terms of Internet connectivity, the World Bank's *World Development
Report 2016: Digital Dividends* found that Bangladesh has the
fifth-largest offline population in the world, with about 148 million
still not connected to the Internet. The report also made it clear that
digital literacy rates are not high in the country. According to a 2016
report, less than 6 percent of adults in the poorest countries, and less
than 1 percent in Bangladesh have attended a literacy program.

Since 1990, Bangladesh's primary education system has made strong
progress toward the Education for All goal of universal primary
enrollment, achieving a 97 percent net primary school enrollment rate by
2013. Nevertheless, the country's education system is hampered by high
dropout rates, non-enrollment among vulnerable communities, and quality
issues. In this environment, poor literacy results are an important
challenge. Only 25 percent of children who complete primary school
achieve the desired competence in Bangla reading, writing, and
vocabulary by the end of fifth grade.

Data shows that libraries are widespread throughout developing
countries, yet are undervalued by social development projects. A 2012
study by Nafiz Zaman Shuva found that there are two major categories of
public libraries in Bangladesh: 68 government-run and 972 non-government
public libraries. The non-government public libraries do not receive any
financial and personnel support from the government. They also lag
behind in terms of infrastructure, especially computers and Internet
facilities. Community libraries, in the form of a small collection of
books located in a local's home, have been aided by nonprofits and
promoted in remote areas.

Project Description
===================

Beyond Access' program in Bangladesh is literacy-focused. The initiative
established a network of 24 libraries located across diverse regions of
Bangladesh. Within this network, Beyond Access introduced early-grade
literacy resources. Before Beyond Access' interventions, these libraries
were targeted almost entirely toward adults and university students.
Despite the fact that Bangladesh has more than 5,000 libraries, more
than 80 percent of children in grades one through three had never used
one. Since the program began in 2015, librarians have shifted the focus
of their work to include and encourage young children by providing not
only reading materials and dedicated space for novice readers, but also
ICT resources. The library-owned tablets available to children who are
learning to read are equipped with educational software where students
can practice the fundamentals of reading and writing, engage in creative
projects, and learn the basics of digital literacy. Librarians receive
training in the use and management of the devices and assist in
monitoring data about the effectiveness of the program.

Progress and Results
====================

Where libraries were once thought of as a resource for practiced
readers, they are now enthusiastically supported as children-friendly
spaces. Parents, teachers, and librarians overwhelmingly support this
shift in purpose. Within a year of the program's implementation, more
than 45,000 visits by children were recorded. The more children-specific
events a library holds, the more attendance they record.

The program in Bangladesh shows specifically how valuable libraries can
be as educational supplements. This demonstrates that not only are
libraries untapped social and community resources, but that they can be
successfully harnessed as strengthening agents in areas where formal
education may be lacking or needing reinforcement. In Bangladesh, where
primary school enrollment is high but retention is low, teachers report
better learning outcomes and smoother classroom management due to the
supplemental literacy programs children engage in at the library.

Challenges
==========

**Rapid government turnover--** The value of libraries rests in large
part on their readymade integration in government funding structures.
Political instability in developing countries, however, can pose
significant challenges to the continuity of these programs, as funding
priorities may shift away from supporting community resources, social
cohesion, and education. For this reason, Beyond Access diversifies its
partners, ensuring that both governmental and non-governmental resources
support each program.

**Community resistance --** Not all librarians are amenable to the
notion that libraries should prioritize more than just books. It can
sometimes be challenging to garner the support of library administrators
for the inclusion of ICT.

**Social norms --** Although the number of children visiting the library
has increased exponentially, many of them spend time there alone.
Parents report difficulty in finding time within the library's schedule
to spend time there with their children, although findings show that
parental presence boosts social and educational outcomes. This
parent-child element of the program has not always been effectively
communicated and/or implemented in the libraries.

Beyond Access' Suggestions for Future Projects
==============================================

**Connecting with anchor organizations is imperative --** IREX does not
have a physical presence in any of the countries where they work, so it
is imperative that they partner with local organizations. This is not
only a logistical necessity; Beyond Access' funding policy is to
contribute no more than 50 percent of each program's total costs. This
local buy-in element of the initiative contributes to the strength of
each program's sustainability, and Beyond Access reports that their
partners almost always succeed in raising more than the required half of
the funds.

**Identification of stable and longstanding resources in target country
helps with the project's sustainability** -- Beyond Access' methodology
centers on sustainability. To this end, they identify stable,
longstanding resources within each country in which they work. By
consulting and partnering with local governments, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and nonprofits, they seek to influence the
priorities of pre-existing institutions and funding structures to
include their library projects. In the case of Bangladesh, this was the
goal of their partnership with Save the Children. By bringing the
attention of such a large and effective funding organization to the
untapped resource of libraries, Beyond Access seeks to make a lasting
impact on the field of social development.
