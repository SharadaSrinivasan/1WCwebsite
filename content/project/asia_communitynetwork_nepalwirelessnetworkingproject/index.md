Executive Summary 
==================

Nepal Wireless Networking Project is a social enterprise that provides
connectivity to villages in Nepal through community Wi-Fi projects.
Since 2001, it has connected over 200 rural hamlets in Nepal to the
Internet. In late 2015, the team helped connect 12 villages in
earthquake-affected areas. It is pioneering a 'Smart Village' to provide
the various benefits of connectivity such as easy access to online
education, government services, health services and smart trekking
routes to communities. Nepal Wireless is also implementing pilot project
for the deployment of a community-based hybrid wireless network using TV
White Space and Wi-Fi spectrum in remote valleys around Manaslu Himalaya
and Dhaulagiri Himalaya region in 2016.

Context
=======

Nepal is a landlocked country with over 70 percent of its population in
rural and remote areas. The terrain in the country is highly
mountainous, which creates multiple challenges in the deployment of
telecommunications infrastructure in many parts of the country. The
country has relatively low mobile broadband penetration, at 25 percent
for a population of over 28.5 million people. In addition, as of 2016,
there is only a 1.2 percent penetration rate for fixed broadband
subscriptions. The country is also one of the poorest countries of the
world, with income per capita at a mere US\$ 730.

Although Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, internet
has become widely available across the country as a result of the many
cyber cafes and public internet access spots (approximately 1100)
located around the country. Additionally, there are over 40 internet
service providers, with the most popular being Nepal Telecom, United
Telecom, and Ncell. The minimum monthly internet cost, offered by Nepal
telecom, is US\$ 8.70.

Project Description
===================

Nepal Wireless started as an effort to bring a telephone line and an
Internet connection to the Himachal Higher Secondary School in the
Mygadi district of Nepal in 1996. After overcoming an environment of
political strife, stringent government regulations, as well as technical
challenges and financial constraints, the first project was completed in
2002. The project's locations -- mostly rural and isolated areas -- are
often inhabited by indigenous subsistence farmers. There are
marginalized or socially disadvantaged groups living in these isolated
villages of the Himalayan regions of Nepal.

By 2008, Internet connections had been provided to community centers,
schools and clinics in 42 villages, with plans to expand to at least 19
more. In 2016, over 200 such villages have been connected to the
Internet and had access to a whole host of services including
telemedicine, online education, and online banking services.

The Nepal Wireless Project uses 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz frequencies to
connect the villages, relay stations and base stations. Most of the
network backbone is connected using Motorola Canopy radios at 5.8 GHz
due to high reliability and to avoid signal interference. Last-mile
connectivity uses wireless Ethernet (802.11b/g standard) radios at 2.4
GHz, which is cheaper and compatible across various manufacturers. In
Mygadi, for instance, the system has two relay stations to forward the
wireless signal to a base station and Linux server facility in Pokhara,
the nearest city with Internet access, with a connection to a hospital
in the city. Users at the school use Internet on desktop computers and
laptops.

The Internet connectivity is used to provide teaching and telemedicine
services to the villagers. While dependent on the distance of a village
from the relay and base stations, most connections provide a minimum
bandwidth of 1 MBp/s in the local network, which allows for video
conferencing facilities. At the telemedicine clinics, doctors use a
network camera that can be controlled remotely.

The project charges a service fee to rural communication centers to
ensure sustainability and cover the operating and maintenance costs of
the network. The management structure allows community organizations to
make their own decisions to run their communication centers and the
system is deployed with active participation from local governments and
youth from the communities.

Progress and Results
====================

The Nepal Wireless Networking project has connected 200 hamlets in
remote, rural and mountainous areas in Nepal. The populations in each of
these villages vary from a few hundreds to a few thousands. This
connectivity provides villagers with vital information for trading their
produce in local markets. Many villages now provide online booking in
trekking areas for tourists. Nepal Wireless has established a mechanism
for online money transfers through different local agencies in rural
areas, which benefits tourists and mountaineers.

There are also educational and health benefits that stem from providing
connectivity to these rural hamlets. Telemedicine services at eight
rural clinics now connect patients in remote villages with Kathmandu
Model Hospital, Skin Hospital, and Pokhara Om Hospital for expert care.
Teleteaching provides children in rural schools with multimedia
educational content on the Internet.

Nepal Wireless has also partnered with several international
organizations and has established weather stations for real time weather
monitoring to assess the impacts of climate change over a long period.

Challenges
==========

**Challenging terrain ---** Some rural communities do not have access
even to a cellular signal, and Internet provisioning for rural areas is
economically cost intensive for traditional telecommunications service
providers.

**Limited and irregular electricity access ---** Because of their
isolation, some of the villages do not have access to an electricity
grid. Instead, the relay stations use alternative sources such as solar
and hydroelectric energy.

**Lack of availability of equipment--** Equipment for deploying community
infrastructure in rural areas of Nepal is often sourced from outside the
country, owing to a low manufacturing base for such components within
the country. This causes delays, and increases costs of deployment.

Nepal Wireless's Suggestions for Future Projects
================================================

**Innovative approaches are needed for deployments in rough terrains
--** Low-cost wireless networks can be used in harsh and remote
locations to provide internet access to dispersed communities in
mountainous regions

**Leveraging community partnerships aids sustainability --** Strong
community support is essential to sustainable connectivity, as well the
provisioning of other types of community services such as telemedicine
and school networks.

**Local capacity building can lower maintenance costs in the long run
--** Strong local capacity building efforts in ICTs leads to a cadre of
local experts who can provide technical assistance in maintaining the
network in the long term.
