Executive Summary 
==================

Infolady Social Enterprise Limited (iSocial), began as a project of
Dnet, a Bangladesh-based social enterprise in 2004. iSocial developed
the Kallyani model (as known as Infolady), a last-mile women-to-women
business network that features young women entrepreneurs known as
Kallyani ('Woman who brings wellbeing' in Bengali) to provide products
and services to rural households from a wide range of arenas including
sexual and reproductive health, nutrition, adolescent, primary
healthcare, agriculture, legal and social safety net entitlement
benefits services, data and connectivity. iSocial deployed the original
form of its current Kallyani model in Bangladesh in 2010, where young
educated women from poor rural communities pays nominal investment which
includes their license fee, working capital, and equipment packages from
local franchisee 'Hubs' in their sub-district, with preferential loans
from National Bank Limited. They receive in-depth training in
entrepreneurship, sales, and accounting, as well as technical
instruction in how to provide simple healthcare services such as blood
pressure measurements, diabetes measurement, pregnancy tests, utilizing
video chat on laptops, and birth registration proceedings, as well as
how to contact iSocial experts if clients have questions or needs beyond
what they can provide. Also, they are trained to conduct several agri
and poultry related services like cattle vaccination, services on
horticulture and aquaculture, fisheries etc. iSocial also provides them
with a bicycle and uniform ( Consisting of a branded apron, a cap and a
badge) with which they can travel to local villages to sell their
services. Local community members in turn pay affordable prices for
services they need, generating an income for Kallyanis and their
household, and challenging restrictive gender roles that otherwise
constrain women's empowerment in rural Bangladesh. As of a 2015 interim
impact evaluation, Kallyanis had overseen over 500,000 sales
transactions, generating on average a monthly income of \$100-125 USD.
The kallyani model is already being replicated globally and "Fanm
Powgre" (Kallyani in Haitian language) in Haiti is the first of its
kind. iSocial is also planning to replicate this model in Nepal.

Context
=======

The majority of Bangladeshis do not have access to the Internet, and
this limitation is particularly pronounced in the country's rural areas.
Bangladesh is a populous country, but a majority of Bangladeshis (over
100,000,000) live outside major cities. These communities in particular
are deprived of the valuable resources ICT has to offer: information
about improved agricultural practices, information on nutrition and
hygiene, grooming on adolescent SRHR (Sexual and reproductive health
rights), access to health and medical services, Right to information
acts, government benefits they are entitled to and how to collect them,
legal aid and resources, and channels for communicating with family
working abroad.

At the same time, women in Bangladesh face many obstacles and
limitations. The average age of marriage for women is 16.4 years old,
and on average women receive only 4.6 years of schooling. Particularly
in rural areas, the woman is expected to remain at home manage the
household while the husband leaves for work and manages finances. Rates
of domestic violence are high, and in some areas, women's physical
mobility is strictly limited: for example, they are pressured to not
leave the house, whether to travel between villages or visit a health
center. The context of adolescent women are more severe. Every 1 in 5
people in Bangladesh is adolescent and only one in ten adolescents are
aware of sexual and reproductive health and hygiene. One in three girls
get married before they reach 18 and half of them get pregnant. Although
nationwide Bangladeshi women have made strides entering the agricultural
and garment industries, it is very rare for women to be employed in
other fields.

In response to this information and connectivity shortfall, the
government of Bangladesh has played a major role promoting ICT sector
growth. Initiatives include a2i, or Access to Information - Bangladesh,
which has incorporated more digital resources into the classroom for
students and increased support for digital entrepreneurs. The government
of Bangladesh has also reaffirmed the key importance of citizens' access
to information, and how empowering this knowledge can be, via the Right
to Information Act 2009 (RTIA). The RTI Act guarantees Bangladeshis'
legal rights to public information about government organizations, their
operations, how to collect benefits, and so on.

Project Description
===================

Dnet, a not-for-profit Social Enterprise, launched the Infolady model
back in 2004 to test and shape the modern women social entrepreneur
model. The first iteration was comprised of 'rural information centers',
outposts containing a computer with preloaded content on agriculture,
health, and legal aid. The information was mostly audio-visual to make
it accessible to non-literate individuals, and the center was staffed to
help rural Bangladeshis operate the computer as well. However, in their
impact evaluation of the original pilot, iSocial found that only men
came to use the centers due to different social barriers and cultural
norms, the main target group of this project who were the women, somehow
were left unreached. In response, Dnet developed a business model in
2010 that would bring last-mile connectivity to rural Bangladeshi women
and to marginalized community, as well as empower Bangladeshi women to
become entrepreneurs, challenging traditional gender roles. This model
was called 'Infolady'. Later in 2016, Dnet launched a for profit social
enterprise iSocial (Infolady Social Enterprise Limited) to run the
Infolady model as a social enterprise.

iSocial, a social enterprise in Bangladesh comes right on the scene with
a country-wide network of women change agents called Kallyani for
delivery of critical strategically important behavioral change
communications, relevant services and products for addressing various
needs and challenges adolescent girls face.

The Kallyani model (previously called as Infolady) trains rural
impoverished women in entrepreneurship and one of five specialization
areas: information, health, agriculture, adolescent, nutrition as well
as e-commerce, mobile banking, internet use, and other digital services.
iSocial provides women uniforms, bicycles to travel from village to
village, a tablet PC, health equipment, products to sell, and other
durables. Kallyani can receive loans with preferential terms from
National Bank, Banladesh, one of iSocial's partners, to purchase their
equipment and training. Kallyani then sell their services for an
affordable price to community members who need them, and generate an
income for themselves and their household.

Kallyani are trained in entrepreneurship and e-commerce based on content
that iSocial has developed. Agricultural and medical technical training
(including scope of practice and patient privacy) is conducted by local
government officials, experts and doctors. Training incorporates
Kallyani's tablet PC, including pre-loaded audiovisual content for
trainees to review on their own. Kallyani also interact with 'clients'
in simulated scenarios and are evaluated before graduating from the
program and becoming certified. Each woman serves a catchment area of
3-4 square kilometers covering 400 households on an average working as
many hours per day as she is able. A typical Kallyani is a woman between
the ages of 18-35, with at least some secondary education. She provides
services in three ways: door-step services to rural community, by way of
activation/campaign/at school, at their home to thematic customer groups
composed of farmers, women, or adolescents. As of 2018, there are 464
Kallyanis working in 09 districts across Bangladesh.

Progress and Results
====================

iSocial's 2015 interim qualitative impact evaluation found that Kallyani
were empowered, well-accepted in their communities, and earned between
USD \$100-150 per month on average. Kallyani are particularly empowered
within a familial context, to provide input to household consumption
decisions, decisions relating to marriage, education and healthcare.
They also demonstrated improved access to economic empowerment,
including increased income generating opportunities, and business tools
and technologies. Finally, Kallyani also experienced improved
socio-cultural abilities, to move freely throughout their villages,
interact with different members of their communities, and transform
social-cultural belief and practice.

Services Kallyani offer include blood pressure readings, blood glucose
monitoring, blood group testing, pregnancy tests, diabetes measurement,
antenatal health care, video chat, Internet browsing, audio-visual
recording, agricultural information, cattle and poultry vaccination,
product sales, and birth registration. Of these, health care services
like blood pressure and blood sugar monitoring, and video chatting are
the most popular. Blood pressure measurements cost about USD \$0.13, and
video chatting about \$1.30 per hour.

On average, Kallyanis work 4-5 hours per day, engaging in 5-15 service
transactions, traveling about 9km by bicycle. When iSocial surveyed
Kallyanis' clients, they found that client satisfaction with the
services provided was 8 out of a scale of 10, and customer satisfaction
with the Kallyani herself 9 out of 10. Clients in particular enjoyed the
affordability of services, quality of equipment, and the empathy and
open-mindedness with which services were provided. Over all, over
500,000 service transactions were made by the 102 Kallyani included in
the impact evaluation, from 2010 to 2015.

iSocial has been working to deploy a similar program in Haiti since
2016, and is also beginning to work in Nepal.

Challenges
==========

**Resistance from male relatives and local opinion leaders to women
traveling by bicycle.** Some rural Bangladeshi residents believe it is
inappropriate for women to travel around different villages, especially
by bicycle. iSocial responded to this pushback by engaging local
government officials supportive of ICT empowerment, local law
enforcement authority, encouraging more progressive opinion leaders to
speak on the subject, and holding 'bicycle campaigns,' where it
encouraged school-children to ride bikes (more socially acceptable).
iSocial says that the Kallyanis have personally not been deterred.

**Licensing and fees an important part of social enterprise model, but a
barrier to entry for some.** Each Kallyani at the end of her training
receives an official license from iSocial and the local government
affirming her competence to provide her services. This is important to
maintain clients' confidence in their service providers. Kallyanis must
also invest BDT 15,000 for their license, working capital and equipment,
which is a crucial component of making iSocial a self-sustaining social
enterprise. Even with preferential loan terms, this cost is a barrier to
entry for some potential Kallyanis. Though the business potential is
higher than any other small business.

**Scaling product partnerships with local companies.** iSocial is
working to partner with local companies to provide their products and
services to Kallyani to sell, effectively reaching more of the "bottom
of the pyramid" market. However, given current delivery costs to rural
areas, there are not enough Kallyani to make this profitable for many
businesses. iSocial anticipates this problem will improve once the
number of Kallyanis in Bangladesh is scaled up. iSocial is also working
towards scaling up the number of kallyanis to 20,000 by end of 2021.

iSocial's Suggestions for Future Projects
=========================================

**Opportunities to collect market data on bottom-of-the-pyramid
populations.** Because Kallyanis are well-integrated with the
communities they serve, Kallyani model represents an opportunity to
collect and disseminate data on rural communities' consumption habits
and preferences. This is valuable information for both local and
international companies trying to expand their market share, but also
for development firms and NGOs.

**Remaining flexible, incorporating new technology, products and
services as they become available is key.** The Kallyani model began by
supplying entrepreneurs with only mobile phones, when mobile phone
penetrance was low and internet connection in rural areas of Bangladesh
was impossible. When internet connectivity become reality, Kallyanis'
hardware and software evolved to match, something iSocial identifies as
a key cause for success. Similarly, the model began just by providing
ICT services, but after a community needs assessment, branched out into
health and agricultural services. Recently, there has been increased
demand for agricultural products: seeds, fertilizer and non-toxic
pesticides, which iSocial is working to supply to customers.
