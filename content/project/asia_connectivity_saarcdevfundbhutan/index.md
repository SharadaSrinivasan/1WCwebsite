Executive Summary 
==================

In 2012, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
Development Fund (SDF), in collaboration with the Department of
Information Technology and Telecom of the Government of Bhutan, launched
the Empowering Rural Communities: Reaching the Unreached project. With a
budget of \$2.53 million, the project aims to generate new employment
opportunities using contemporary ICTs and ensure citizens in the rural
areas of SAARC countries can access government services. In Bhutan, the
plan called for the construction of 60 community centers and trained 50
community center operators to staff the locations as well.

Context
=======

The objective of Bhutan's five-year development plan is self-reliance
and green, inclusive socio-economic development, and the outcomes are
defined at the national, sectoral, and Dzongkhag (administrative and
judicial district) levels. Government to Citizen Services (G2C) was
initiated in 2010 to increase efficiency and transparency in public
service delivery through the use of information and communications
technologies (ICTs). Online services are made available through 131
community centers (CCs) connected to the Internet. Under the National
Broadband Master plan project, fiber optic cables have currently reached
all 20 Dzongkhags and 201 Gewogs (group of villages). The South Asia
Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Information Highway Project is
installing high bandwidth connectivity directly to India, Nepal, and
Bangladesh. More than 96 government organizations are connected through
the Thimphu Wide Area Network (TWAN) as well. Of the 200 CCs that have
been established, 187 CCs have broadband Internet connectivity while the
remaining will be connected by 2018. Computers are being made freely
accessible to some rural communities to facilitate learning, and an
information technology (IT) park was established in Babesa in 2011.

Project Description
===================

Conceived in 2011 and launched in April 2013, the SAARC Development
Funds' Empowering Rural Communities: Reaching the Unreached project
targets the rural areas of four countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal,
and the Maldives. In each case, the SDF's aim was to generate employment
opportunities for the region and use ICTs to foster the growth of
commerce and entrepreneurship. In the case of Bhutan, \$2.53 million
dollars was allocated for the construction of 50 community centers
intended to service 18 of the 20 Bhutanese Dzongkhags. Beyond providing
training and connectivity to rural villagers, the community centers also
aim to offer residents with more access to services provided by the
Bhutanese government. The community centers are hoped to lessen the
turn-around time when citizens communicate with governmental bodies, and
can help with tasks that are made difficult by remote or rural locations
(e.g., taking passport-size photos). The government seeks to roll this
out to all community centers nationwide

Progress and Results
====================

Initially, community centers in 50 Gewogs were established under the
project, but thanks to savings in the project fund, CCs in 10 additional
Gewogs were established -- meaning 60 CCs that were funded by SDF in
total. The SDF trained 50 community center operators to staff the
locations as well. Following the completion of the project, the
Bhutanese government promised its citizens that it will open a community
center in each of the country's 205 Gewogs.

As the community centers prosper, new services are being integrated into
the existing repertoire of offerings. One emerging business model is for
individuals to conduct banking at the community centers via the
Internet. Many banks have already signed on, and more and more community
centers will be included, as it is a feasible model.

In terms of commerce, a similar project is in the works to provide each
community center with a unique webpage allowing residents of the Gewogs
to sell local crafts and merchandise online. It is also hoped that these
sites can showcase the unique culture of specific areas and boost
tourism.

The community centers help to equalize the knowledge bases of students
between the urban and rural communities as well. Some community centers
are teaching rural children computer basics during school breaks, and
these centers have requested more computers because there is
considerable interest. Adults, monks, and laypeople also attend computer
trainings and in some centers, they are being taught Dzongkhag Unicode.

While the success of the ICT intervention for rural Bhutanese citizens
is paramount, the community centers also offer useful offline services
as well. The services most taken advantage of by citizens are
photocopying, taking passport photos, and legal stamps.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of skilled manpower --** Because a community center only has a
single qualified operator, the community suffers when this individual is
unavailable. Financial limitations have also made it impossible to
increase the number of operators per community center.

**Lack of access to devices** **--** User feedback indicated that more
computer systems are needed at the locations, specifically to increase
the number of community members that could take basic computer classes.

SDF's Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================

**Offline services at community centers can aid take-up** - Villagers in
rural areas of Bhutan can sell goods, encourage tourism, and interact
with the larger world. The community centers also serve a second purpose
beyond providing technology and know-how. The public has made good use
of the offline services offered by the community centers, including the
photocopiers.

**Partnership with government is beneficial--** The success of the
Bhutan segment of the project is indicative of the project's
scalability. In Bhutan, the government has already taken steps to scale
the project by constructing community centers in other Gewogs as well.

**Cultural specificity should be taken into account -** While the
Bhutanese case was particularly successful, other similar projects were
impeded by a variety of causes. In Nepal and the Maldives, governmental
unreliability reportedly hampered the success of the projects. In
advance of launching a pilot, it is recommended to consider
geographically specific cultural and governmental frameworks.
