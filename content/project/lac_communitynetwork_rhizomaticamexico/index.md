Executive Summary  {#executive-summary .ListParagraph}
==================

Rhizomatica is a not-for-profit organization based out of rural Oaxaca,
Mexico, that deployed the country's first independent GSM network in
2014. It has connected sixteen communities through community-owned and
operated micro-telecommunications enterprises and leveraging open-source
efforts to provide affordable connectivity, each ranging about 5000
people until 2017 and conducts workshops and courses for trainers to
connect more communities.

Context {#context .ListParagraph}
=======

Mexico had 33 million Internet users as of December 2010, which amounts
to only 29% of the population of the world's most populous
Spanish-speaking country. Urban and rural teledensity differ
significantly, with over 41% penetration in urban areas and below 5%
penetration in the most rural areas of the country. Rural communities in
Mexico that are economically disadvantaged are not an economically
viable market for the incumbent providers, who also do not have a
compulsory license obligation to serve underserved or unconnected
communities. The state of Oaxaca represents amongst the most backward
regions in the country, with over 53% of the people living in small
communities of fewer than 2,500 people each.

A 2012 OECD report estimated that the welfare loss caused by poor
telecommunication infrastructure was nearly 1.8% of the Mexican GDP.
Prior to 2013, small communities such as Villa Talea de Castro relied on
high-cost landline phone booths for their only means of connectivity,
with the Internet remaining a far cry away. The lack of connectivity
manifested in difficulties to access emergency healthcare and access to
educational content, which contributed to the continued backwardness of
some regions of the country. The lack of governmental ability to connect
these communities due to significant geographical problems and the cost
of infrastructure provisioning meant that communities in rural Oaxaca
remained unconnected.

Project Description {#project-description .ListParagraph}
===================

In 2013, Rhizomatica began providing technical and legal support to
communities interested in deploying user-owned and operated networks
using open-source technologies. Inspired by an ad hoc initiative to
connect underserved communities in Nigeria, Rhizomatica provides
unconnected communities in Oaxaca with appropriate technology deployed
using a community-led, consensus-based administration model in order to
provide telecommunications access.

There are three infrastructural components to the Rhizomatica system: a
Radio Access Network, a computer suite administrative system, and an
internet connection. The Radio Access Network uses the 850mHz band to
connect users to the network. The Internet connectivity is provided
through a partnership with Protokol, which also routes external calls
through VoIP. Equipment design is in conjunction with inventors and
manufacturers and leverages open source technologies such as OpenBTS,
which brings down the network set-up costs to US\$ 2,500.

Rhizomatica leverages the strong community organizing structures in
rural Mexico, with leaders required to submit a formal petition to work
with Rhizomatica following a unanimous community vote. This is to ensure
that the community as a whole agrees to the use and maintenance of the
network, creating a sustainable model for its use in the long term.
Communities must also make an initial investment of MXN 30,000 to cover
installation costs as well as costs of training for community members to
operate the equipment. Rhizomática receives a percentage of monthly
subscription fees from the community upon deployment of the full
network, which amounts to MXN 8-10 per user depending on the size of the
community and the number of subscribers. Community members are trained
to maintain the networks, with Rhizomatica only playing a supporting
role after initial network setup. Rhizomatica provides training
materials and workshops, as well as guides on its wiki for those
interested in deploying OpenBTS.

The pilot programs in Sierra Juárez of Oaxaca and Santa Maria Yaviche
have provided up to 500 and 700 individuals with Internet access. In
five years, Rhizomática aims to reach at least 200 sites serving
approximately 150,000 people and to create a conducive regulatory
framework within Mexican telecommunications law to enable access to the
necessary frequency spectrum in rural areas.

Progress and Results {#progress-and-results .ListParagraph}
====================

Rhizomatica presently serves sixteen rural communities of 2,500 or fewer
inhabitants, providing the first Internet access to these communities.
This connectivity facilitates mobile and internet services for banking
and healthcare, communication in case of emergencies home delivery
services, and community-wide messaging by local leaders.

Rhizomatica has also had an impact on the regulatory regime in Mexico as
well. Rhizomatica's pilot programs have aided its advocacy efforts with
the regulatory agency to approve mulitiple rural service providers.
Industry regulators as well as the Secretary of Communication and
Transportation have acknowledged the importance of Rhizomatica's
project, and in July 2016, the Mexican regulator granted a frequency
access concession under the new regime to Telecomunicaciones Indígenas
Comunitarias A.C., a local not-for-profit set up by Rhizomatica in the
five states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz. This
new authority enables it to serve nearly 5,000 communities in these
regions.

Challenges {#challenges .ListParagraph}
==========

**Geographical barriers to connecting remote areas:** As of 2010, some
rural communities did not have access even to a cellular signal, where
service provisioning was not economically viable. The problem is
particularly acute in small rural communities that housed fewer than
5,000 residents.

**Lack of affordability of service:** Internet access was unavailable
most of these regions, forcing people to travel long distances to get
access to reliable connectivity, incurring high transaction costs.

**Regulatory Barriers:** Mexico occupies the bottom of the OECD ranks
for Internet adoption and network investment. Telecom licenses were
governed by a concessions regime under which only one provider in each
of the country's nine regions was nominated to provide rural Internet
access. This acted as a barrier to small service providers to set up and
provide connections to rural markets, until legislation for sectoral
reform was passed in 2014.

Rhizomatica's Suggestions for Future Projects {#rhizomaticas-suggestions-for-future-projects .ListParagraph}
=============================================

**Self-sustaining community-owned and operated cellular networks are a
viable alternative to traditional buildouts** -- They have the potential
to make innovative use of open source technologies to provide the first
low-cost connectivity in areas that are economically unviable for
incumbent operators.

**Training of community members is** **essential** -- a system that
incentivizes community buy-in, creates sustainable models that provides
long-term connectivity solutions.

**Consistent advocacy for regulatory reform** -- Regulatory advocacy
should be combined with technological innovation in deployment in order
for the benefits to reach more communities.
