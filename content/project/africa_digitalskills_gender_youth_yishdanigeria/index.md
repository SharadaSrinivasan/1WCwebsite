Executive Summary 
==================

Youth Initiative for Sustainable Human Development in Africa (YISHDA) is
a nonprofit organization that provides leadership training for youth in
Nigeria. They provide training in the areas of education, information
and communications technology (ICT) development, civic engagement, and
business development, including employment training in building a résumé
and cultivating soft skills. These programs bring youth and women to
area libraries, with mutually beneficial impacts for libraries and
users. YISDHA is developing a network of libraries in Nigeria equipped
with ICTs and resources. The project is partnered with Beyond Access,
the Universal Services Provision Fund (USPF), and the National IT
Development Agency (NITDA).

Context 
=======

By 2014, the Nigerian economy had become the largest in Africa; yet,
poverty and unemployment remain high -- particularly for women and
youth. Nigeria has nearly 11 million unemployed youth, and women account
for approximately 55 percent of that group. And less than half of the
population has access to the Internet and the economic, social, and
educational benefits it provides. While government agencies are already
making investments in public access technology and nongovernmental
organizations are working on workforce development programs, often these
initiatives are not well connected.

Project Description 
===================

Youth Initiative for Sustainable Human Development in Africa is working
to build a network of libraries across Nigeria that can serve as a
durable platform for ongoing training and services aimed at developing
the digital, employability, and entrepreneurship skills of women and
youth in the country. The project is creating a network of libraries
throughout Nigeria that are equipped to support women and youth who want
to enhance their digital, employability, and entrepreneurship skills.

The project partners with the United States-based nonprofit organization
Beyond Access, the Universal Services Provision Fund, and the National
IT Development Agency to ensure that the libraries have the adequate
technology and Internet connectivity needed to serve as training
locations for young Nigerians between the ages of 8 and 30 looking for
opportunities to gain the skills they need to enhance their economic
opportunities.

YISHDA brings young people into the library to increase the libraries'
use and also educate them. They work with 37 libraries in the north;
there, 20 libraries participated in the Beyond Access program, and were
equipped by the Universal Services Provision Fund (USPF) with facilities
that include 50 computers and Internet access.

They provide training using the Intel Easy Step modules. The topics
include computer basics, productivity software, and practical computer
exercises. The librarians are trained in vision and techniques for
implementing new library services, managing ICT equipment and services,
advocacy and partnership development, connecting users to economic
opportunities at the library through developing skills, and accessing
information.

YISHDA have developed a low-cost sustainability model. Phase one is free
for participants, while phase two is free for libraries.

Progress and Results
====================

The global nonprofit organization IREX has been working with nine public
libraries in Nigeria since May 2015. Since then, 210,000 people visited
the libraries, 268 computers have become available to use, 62,500
visitors used a computer, and librarians trained 4,890 visitors. In
total, 1,220 trainees have finished a multi-day course on ICT literacy
and workforce development. Of those trainees, 46 percent of them were
women, while 73 percent of them were under age 25. Additionally, 77
percent of them reported improved ICT skills. YISHDA followed up with
the participants shortly after the program, and 19 of them had started
businesses.

The impact for the libraries has also been substantial. The increased
number of patrons from the project has enabled the continued operation
and expansion of library services. Beyond Access has also trained more
than 100 librarians from 72 libraries in every zone of Nigeria. In seven
months, those librarians reported more than 300,000 visitors and over
16,000 participants in library programs.

Challenges 
==========

**Limited electricity access --** Unreliable electricity is a challenge
when technologies require a steady power supply to be functional.

**Lack of Internet access --** Even in cases where libraries have the
necessary technology and nominally have an Internet connection, the
connection and the signal strength are weak and/or unreliable.

**Lack of sustained funding --** Funding the project has been a
challenge. The libraries that host the resources as well as the users
all require support and training.

**Insufficient data** **--** Libraries without technology and Internet
had difficulty to collect data in terms of the number of the
participants and share that with stakeholders.

YISHDA's Suggestions For Future Projects  
=========================================

**Mutually beneficial programing and engaging multiple stakeholders to
advance common goals is helpful --** The success of the project comes
from providing a benefit to both the users and the libraries that host
them for training. Using technology centers in libraries that are trying
to secure more support helps everyone involved -- both the trainees and
the libraries themselves.
