Executive Summary 
==================

Pohnpei Catholic School is located in Kolonia town of Pohnpei State in
the Federated States of Micronesia. The school was awarded a grant by
the Internet Society's (ISOC) Community Grant Programme in June 2014.
The goal was to create a wireless Internet network at the school and
allow teachers to incorporate the Internet into classroom activities. As
of April 2017, the project has not achieved their short- and long-term
goals due to various challenges, but it has brought benefits to the
teachers.

 Context
========

Pohnpei Catholic School is located at the center of Kolonia, a coastal
town and the previous capital of Pohnpei State in the Federated States
of Micronesia (FSM). It is one of the most populated places on Pohnpei
and the commercial hub of the island, with a population of around 6,000
based on 2010 Census data. According to a 2005 report, male-headed
household income in Pohnpei is US\$ 76.9 on average, while female-headed
household income is US\$ 23.1 on average. Moreover, the government is
the largest employer in Kolonia.

Although Pohnpei is connected to a fiber optic cable line, the Internet
is rarely available on island. The minimum payment for household
Internet line with ADSL is US\$ 33. The island suffers from low
penetration rates, and most people use the Internet while at work.
According to a 2015 report, the fixed broadband subscription rate per
100 inhabitants in Micronesia is 3 percent while the mobile subscription
rate is 21.5 percent.

In Kolonia, there are very few public Internet access sites for the
community. At Pohnpei Public Library, Internet use has recently become
free thanks to government support from the legislature. The library is
open during business hours (9:00 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, 10 a.m. to
2 p.m. on Saturdays) to the public. Other than that, there is free
Internet at the state hospital and at the airport. The FSM
Telecommunications Corporation also hosts a small number of computers in
their lobby for Internet use through a prepaid phone card, which costs
US\$ 0.08 per megabyte. Users can also connect to the Internet from
their laptops or at the company's 14 hotspots available around the
island.

 Project Description
====================

At Pohnpei Catholic School, there are approximately 370 K-9 students and
15 teachers. The school has a computer lab with about 10 computers. The
primary motivation behind providing Internet access to the school was to
connect the teachers so that they could find additional resources for
their classes given that minimal research texts and up-to-date books
available at the library, and enable students to conduct online
research.

With the ISOC grant, the school has built three wireless hubs across
three different buildings at the school, and the school administrators
purchased 20 7-inch tablets. Since the school has an Internet budget of
US\$ 1,260 a year for their monthly access fee, the project's short-term
goal is to increase bandwidth so that full class of students, which
tends to be 20-25 students, can use the Internet at once. The long-term
goal is to provide capacity building programs, such as offering computer
classes to high school students, providing specific Internet skills or
software training classes, and more information for parents.

Progress and Results
====================

Since the installation of a wireless network in March 2015, the project
has not achieved its short-term or long-term goals due to various
challenges. As of April 2017, the school is still working to realize
their short-term goal of increasing bandwidth. And while the students
have not begun to benefit from the connectivity as much as hoped, it has
benefited teachers.

All 15 teachers have their own personal laptop and were trained in
Internet use. They use the connection to access information and plan
their lessons. Internet connectivity has also facilitated communication
between teachers and parents. Teachers can easily inform parents about
the student's activities and progress through email as well as through
the school's Facebook page due to the connectivity provided by this
project.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of community ownership --** Due to lack of resources, the
implementation of the project relied on volunteers. Although there were
information technology (IT) experts among the parents, getting enough
parents to volunteer to dig the lines and lay the cables was a
challenge, and it took time. The project was perceived as low-priority
by parents compared to their other obligations with family and work. As
a result, the implementation of the project took more than six months.

**Social norms --** Once the volunteers stepped in, there were also
delays completing the tasks due to cultural perceptions of time. In
polychromic cultures like Micronesia, punctuality is firmly based on the
relationship rather than the task, and plans tend to change easily. This
has led to the cancelation and rescheduling of planned activities.

**Lack of affordable access** -- The school's budget is limited to
upgrade the connection speed and provide enough bandwidth for the 20
tablets to access the Internet at the same time. The system cannot
afford for many students to get online at the same time; therefore, it
often crashes, which leaves students frustrated. Since there is only one
telecommunications company, the available packages for education are
limited. The only available educational package for schools is directed
to connecting the school's administration, such as the principal, but
not students. Thus, the project would benefit from the availability of
affordable educational packages.

Pohnpei Catholic School's Suggestions for Future Projects
=========================================================

**Considering local sensitivities is important --** The project team's
experience suggests that project managers may benefit from taking
possible social, cultural, and economic barriers into consideration
while setting their goals and timeline. In addition, they suggest
conducting research about the available resources upfront and prepare
key data, such as the affordability and availability of services.
Maintaining flexibility and creating a "plan B" for when things do not
go as planned also seems prudent.

**Engaging communities in the implementation process is useful --**
Organizations can benefit from partnerships with community members
during the implementation of these initiatives to encourage volunteerism
in the community and provide digital literacy skills to support those
programs. The team highlighted how social and technical support for this
process and knowledge sharing in the community can help sustain networks
in the long term.
