Executive Summary 
==================

The Universal Service Fund of Pakistan (USF) is a not-for-profit entity
that operates under the aegis of the Government of Pakistan. Its goal is
to bring fiber-optic connectivity to Pakistan's sparsely populated rural
regions that are unserved by Internet service providers (ISPs). The USF
incentivizes private businesses to provide connectivity to sites where
it would have been otherwise unprofitable by disbursing subsidies. In
addition to facilitating infrastructural development in these rural
districts, the USF implements and oversees a number of special projects
that aim to enhance these new users' Internet use. While rural
connectivity has been rolled out with some success, some of these
programs have yet to find their footing.

Context 
=======

Located in southern Asia, Pakistan is the world's sixth-most populated
country. Approximately a third of Pakistan's 200 million citizens live
in urban centers. The rest populate sub-districts across a variety of
terrains, including mountains and deserts. Since so many Pakistani
citizens live in rural regions, most are engaged in agriculture;
however, these people are generally economically disadvantaged. Of the
39 percent of the Pakistani population that is living at or below the
poverty line, 55 percent hail from non-urban areas.

Recently, Internet costs in Pakistan have fallen considerably. Yet, due
to the difficult economic situation in the county, undergirded by
cultural norms and low literacy rates, much of the Pakistani population
is not connected to the Internet. According to the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), Pakistan has one of the lowest Internet
access rates in the world, at 18 percent; however, the 2014 launch of 3G
and 4G mobile telecommunications services in the country as well as
initiatives aimed at digital literacy are slowly increasing
accessibility. In 2017, Pakistan launched its first free public Wi-Fi
network in the Punjab province. The network is meant to service more
than 160,000 users by providing them with access for four hours each
day.

Project Description 
===================

The Universal Service Fund in Pakistan is mandated to provide high-speed
connectivity to areas that are without access to the Internet. It is
overseen by a board constituted by the government ministers of
information technology (IT) and telecommunications, and as well as
nominees from the private sector in Internet servicing, mobile and
fixed-line providers, and consumer regulation.

USF ensures connectivity to the country's sparsely populated areas by
providing government subsidies to private telecommunication companies.
They auction off bundles of sub-districts (between 10 and 20
sub-districts an auction, out of 130 total unserved sub-districts), and
sell each project to the lowest private sector bidder. Each project for
sale stipulates that in exchange for subsidized operational costs, the
company must provide fiber-optic cable and installation as well as 10
years guaranteed Internet service. In addition, two fibers in each cable
must remain open for a competing service provider to purchase.

When the program began in 2006, voice access was the most widely used
form of connectivity. Gradually, interest in and knowledge of Internet
services beyond phone access has grown as digital literacy becomes more
prevalent. As of June 2017, around 7,000 kilometers of cable are
servicing 100 rural sub-districts.

The USF is currently working to improve its training programs in digital
literacy, meet the specific needs of the populations it serves, and
enhance Internet access with more granular attention to particular
village clusters within these newly (and still partially) serviced
sub-districts.

Progress and Results
====================

Even when the network was being predominantly used for voice access,
connectivity was immediately a boon to communities. Staying in touch
with friends and relatives abroad was especially important to these
remote communities, from which people often traveled to work in cities
or abroad. Voice access also had a significant impact on farmers in
these areas. They are able to make use of advice lines for problems with
their crops or animals as well as check with reliable sources about the
market price for their goods. Before, they were entirely dependent on
middlemen to price their commodities.

A number of residents of these areas have been using the Internet to
access training videos in order to improve or learn certain skills that
increase their employability. USF has implemented a plan in which they
set up strategically placed telecom centers that provide information and
training for new Internet users, as well as computer stations for public
use. These centers were not widely used once 3G and 4G access was
introduced, and people began relying on their personal devices instead.
Certain special projects' centers were, however, more successful.

USF has a number of specifically focused special projects. Information
and communications technologies (ICTs) for Girls is a program that seeks
to empower women from marginalized communities through training in
digital literacy and Internet and communication technologies. So far,
they have set up 50 centers that serve 4,000 women. There are also sites
set up in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh that aim to help users
with disabilities. These services target Pakistanis with visual
impairments, and provide adaptive training and accessibility tools for
Internet access and job skills and searches. USF is also currently in
the planning stages for a telemedicine project that would connect major
hospitals with remote villages.

Challenges 
==========

**Geographical and infrastructural barriers** -- Laying fiber-optic
cable is difficult in many of the areas USF seeks to serve. The terrain
is often very difficult to navigate, and desert region temperatures can
rise above 50 degrees Celsius during the summer. Transportation
infrastructure is not well developed in some places as well, making
access difficult due to lack of roads. Mountains too can pose problems
for access and connectivity. In addition, some areas to which USF would
like to provide connectivity remain inaccessible due to concerns
regarding safety, security, and violence, with active conflict
especially prevalent in certain border zones. Due to the region's sparse
population and remote location, it is difficult to attract and maintain
interest from businesses even with the subsidies.

**Regulatory challenges --** USF notes the urgent need for revised rules
for conducting its subsidy auctions. The major issue is the difference
between Internet infrastructure and more traditional infrastructures,
such as transportation. In the case of the Internet, the government
facilitates the building, maintenance, and (some) usage of the
infrastructure, but has no ownership stake in it whatsoever. This
complicates the rules of procurement usually set in stone for these
auctions, as nothing is materially being procured.

**Political pressure --** Since USF is government-funded, those
functionaries in charge of its financing and development often face
pressure from politicians who want, for personal reasons, to divert
funds to less needy projects or constituencies.

**Low rates of digital literacy --** Although the rates of adoption
among populations with low levels of general literacy have been
promising, USF has not been able to satisfactorily address gaps in
digital literacy for residents in these newly connected rural areas.
Many people are able to quickly learn how to use connectivity for
entertainment and social networking, and a few have been taking
advantages of online skills training, yet most lack knowledge of the
potentials for farther-reaching benefits of connectivity. The telecom
centers built by USF to advance this purpose have not functioned as
especially successful vehicles for digital literacy training.

USF's Suggestions for Future Projects 
=====================================

**Equal focus on demand and supply-side barriers is needed --** Like
many programs of its kind, USF first focused the majority of its
attentions on supply. Now that the network has been largely established,
they can focus their attention on the demand side, homing in on the
benefits of digitizing government applications and license procedures.
This double-focus is useful for a healthy implementation plan, which
generally focuses on ways that connectivity will serve the particular
needs of a certain area/population and have the greatest impact on their
well-being and potential.

**Affordability is necessary for ubiquitous usage --** Pakistan has one
of the most affordable rates of Internet access in the world. Their
model depends largely on the exceptionally low cost of Internet access,
mobile phones, and wireless-capable devices, as well as their
stipulation that telecom companies be forbidden from raising rates in
these areas. Their business model, then, may not be as effective in
places where rural inhabitants could not afford standard rates of
connectivity.
