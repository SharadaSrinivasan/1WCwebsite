Executive Summary 
==================

The Jamaica TV White Space Pilot project extends affordable broadband in
rural communities in Jamaica using Television white space (TVWS)
spectrum. The program seeks to address socio-economic inequities by
implementing broadband networks to extend connectivity to schools,
health clinics, and community centers in rural areas. The pilot aims to
provide Jamaica's rural residents with educational opportunities, access
to business optimization tools, employment opportunities in the
information and communications technology (ICT) sector, and facilitate
delivery of e-government services. The pilot deployed in partnership
with the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID)
Global Broadband and Innovations Program, with support from the Jamaica
Universal Services Fund (USF). The pilot currently connects 31 sites
across seven parishes with 2,000 users and aims to reach an additional
5,000 users.

Context
=======

Vision 2030, Jamaica's National Development Plan, envisages a
technologically enabled society as one of six key determinants of a
prosperous economy. Jamaica determined that connectivity and
technological infrastructure plays a central role in building strong
economic infrastructure. As a consequence, e-readiness is an outcome
indicator in Vision 2030.

In 2007, Jamaica scored 3.8 (out of 10) on the e-readiness index. The
government set a goal of achieving an index score of 4.9 in 2015 and 7.5
by 2030. As a measure of comparison, 7.5 was the minimum score for the
top 20 countries in 2008.

Project Description
===================

This pilot connects schools, health clinics, and community centers to
the Internet using TVWS -- unused parts of the spectrum of radio
frequencies originally set aside for analog television. It provides
rural residents access to educational opportunities through online
books, distance learning programs, and other essential educational
resources at schools. The pilot also supports economic empowerment by
providing access to market information at community centers and reducing
information asymmetries, and enables access to responsive e-government
services.

Thirty-one rural sites received broadband connectivity using TVWS
spectrum. Pilot sites did not have prior connections to the Internet.
They include nine base stations, nine health centers, seven libraries,
six police stations, and 17 schools. Each of these 31 sites has an
Adaptrum radio and wireless access point for local connectivity. Nine
towers spread across seven parishes with existing broadband connectivity
were used to anchor the installation of additional antennae. FLOW, a
major partner in this effort, owns the towers, and each tower was fitted
with four sector radios for unidirectional coverage. Microsoft supported
this deployment by providing education and community-focused software to
enable users to find relevant content online.

Progress and Results
====================

The Jamaica TVWS Pilot connected 31 rural sites, and has since been
transitioned to the Jamaica Universal Service Fund project manager to
add an additional 5,000 users to the current 2,000.

In June 2015, FLOW worked through a series of acquisitions and mergers.
Adaptrum, Cisco Systems, and Microsoft trained the pilot's management
and technical teams in system deployment and management. By November
2015, 31 schools, libraries, and other community locations were fitted
with broadband equipment. Microsoft continues to provide technical
support for network deployment to this pilot, and has helped to expand
it to other rural locations through other education and
community-focused technology grants.

Jamaican partners of this pilot, the USF, FLOW, and government
ministries, have plans to extend the reach of the network to bring
connectivity to 5,000 more people, and to continue to invest in
affordable broadband access to underserved rural communities. There is
discussion concerning commercializing TVWS in Jamaica in the future, as
well as replicating this model in other countries.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sufficient and affordable TVWS equipment** -- TVWS radio
availability is a key determinant of project success, as there are
currently a small group of companies manufacturing TVWS radios at small
volumes. Owing to the lack of scale in this industry, pricing for these
radios is currently high.

**Regulatory uncertainty --** A great risk to the long-term success and
scalability of these TVWS pilot projects is getting governments to adopt
regulations enabling unlicensed or license-exempt access to TVWS.

Jamaica TVWS Pilot's Suggestions for Future Projects
====================================================

**New technological solutions can help in areas with severe
infrastructure limitations --** Broadband delivered through TVWS is able
to propagate over a longer distance compared to traditional Wi-Fi or
cellular signals, and is significantly less affected by hilly terrain.
This makes TVWS a more practical and affordable option for hilly rural
areas where homes, businesses, and community buildings can tend to be
far apart.

**TV White Spaces can provide affordable connectivity for sparsely
populated areas --** TVWS solutions are comparatively low-cost due to
their use of unlicensed frequencies, and can be powered by solar power
due to their low energy requirements. Their use of lower frequencies
allow the signal to reach distances of up to 10 kilometers, even in
areas with rough terrain, heavy rainfall, and dense foliage. This
combination of low costs and coverage allows providers to provide fast
broadband at affordable rates for rural populations. This helps bridge
the affordability barrier for digital inclusion.
