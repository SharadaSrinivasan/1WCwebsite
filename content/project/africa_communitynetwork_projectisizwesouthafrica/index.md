Executive Summary  
==================

Project Isizwe is a non-profit organization in South Africa. Founded in
2013, it aims to connect low-income communities across South Africa to
free, high-quality Wi-Fi networks at the lowest possible cost in public
spaces. Project Isizwe seeks to promote education within these
communities by providing Internet connectivity. Since its inception,
Project Isizwe has connected around 3 million South Africans to free,
public Wi-Fi, and provided access to information and opportunities.
Through the project's efforts, individuals have obtained more than 200
jobs and benefited from 11,000 online digital literacy programs.

Context 
=======

Project Isizwe is based in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, which
has a population of more than 2.1 million. South Africa is one of the
most expensive countries in Africa in terms of price per 1 gigabyte (GB)
of data. Based on the Alliance for Affordable Internet's *Affordability
Report 2016*, an affordable mobile Internet connection (priced at about
1.5 percent of average monthly income) costs between 7 and 15 percent of
monthly income of almost half of South Africa's population. The cost for
lower income users is around 20 percent of average monthly income, for 1
GB of data. Recently, the municipality of the City of Tshwane began
subsidizing Internet access. In Pretoria alone, there are over 700
public Internet access zones including schools, clinics, and libraries,
due to collaborative efforts between the City of Tshwane and Project
Isizwe.

Project Description 
===================

Project Isizwe aims to bring free Wi-Fi within walking distance to every
South African through public Wi-Fi hotspots. Project Isizwe partners
with municipalities to plan, install, and launch free Wi-Fi for
low-income communities using existing infrastructure, and work with
local companies who provide the necessary labor and resources. The
project is able to purchase bandwidth at discounted rates, which drives
down costs to less than 1 rand (US\$ 0.072) per day per user. This
discount is consequential as it makes it affordable for the government
to subsidize free Wi-Fi. Users' daily data limit is 500 megabytes (MB)
per day per device on the network. While Internet access is free,
content is restricted -- the hotspots do not allow people to stream
violent programs or view pornographic images or videos.

Due to high demand on the part of the community of Pretoria, Project
Isizwe has expanded to 1,050 hotspots. Hotspots were deployed
strategically in order to increase the effectiveness of Wi-Fi usage by
the public. Project Isizwe placed hotspots at calculated locations (such
as parks, next to schools, in libraries, hospitals, and police stations)
where the public can easily gather and access the network.

Project Isizwe also partnered with local nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) to offer educational programs and online courses to the
community. Notably, they offer free online digital literacy programs on
their network. They are working on a business model that would allow
them to sustain their services.

Progress and Results 
====================

In 2013, Project Isizwe deployed 35 free Wi-Fi hotspots and allotted 250
MB limits per device per day. As of late 2017, they have deployed 1,050
free Wi-Fi hotspots around South Africa, and allow 500 MB of data usage
per day per device. Currently they have 3 million unique users, which
include 600,000 unique users per month and 330,000 people who log onto
the Internet every day. Project Isizwe has also partnered with Facebook
to deploy more hotspots.

In addition to providing users with free Wi-Fi, Project Isizwe has
developed a content portal that focuses on education, skills
development, and employment. It allows local communities to access
information, education, and jobs. Through this portal, 11,000 citizens
have completed online digital literacy trainings and around 222 users
have found a job. The project is working with local NGOs to develop
online tools such as chess tournaments and programs that build awareness
about cyber bullying.

Project Isizwe has also partnered with international technology
companies like Mozilla to create an online platform to empower
low-income women to pursue resources and opportunities for health and
finance.

Challenges 
==========

**Equipment damage --** The hotspots are susceptible to theft and
lightning. As the number of hotspots increases, maintenance of existing
equipment is a challenge due to limited financial and human resources.

**Lack of skilled manpower --** The project faces a challenging task of
maintaining a complex and rapidly expanding network as a non-profit
organization with limited resources. As the project becomes more
successful in terms of its range and impact, it is harder to keep up
with the increasing technical, human, and financial needs this success
brings. It is difficult to replace damaged equipment given capacity
constraints.

**Regulation --** Changes to the political leadership influences the
current effort. Some state policies limit new designs of digital
equipment, and changes in information technology (IT) policies to
address innovation are often perceived unnecessary by the South African
authorities. This instability and inconsistency impacts the ability to
make decisions and plan for the project's sustainable development in the
long-term.

**Lack of awareness among users** -- The project faces the challenge in
engaging public perception that believes that Internet access is often a
luxury. Making the case for the benefits of connectivity, when several
people believe that there are more pressing issues to be addressed,
remains a challenge. There are also very limited platforms to share the
message of Internet access and its social necessity to improve
awareness.

Project Isizwe's Suggestions for Future Projects 
================================================

**Public-private partnerships contribute to project success in a big
way--** Project Isizwe cited effective public-private partnerships as a
major contribution to its success. The project has partnered with
municipalities to help subsidize the cost of the network, and with local
NGOs to improve outreach for their programs. Project Isizwe also works
with international companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and Mozilla to
provide infrastructure and technical support.

**Government partnerships to spread awareness can be helpful --**
Project Isizwe notes that the role of the government can expand beyond
merely a financial one. Government partnership is equally important in
building awareness about the significance of connectivity among
stakeholders in these initiatives. The lack of this awareness may slow
or hinder the processes that aim to build, expand, and sustain
connectivity projects.
