# Executive Summary 

Digital Village Squares is an Indian corporate social responsibility
initiative implemented by American Tower Corporation in collaboration
with the NIIT Foundation and Hole in the Wall Education Limited (HiWEL).
HiWEL learning stations and digital literacy training classes by the
NIIT Foundation are now available at 51 Squares in rural India. Students
can engage in self-paced interactive learning through the learning
stations, and adults are trained in basic computer skills using the
National Digital Literacy Mission's curriculum at these locations.

Context
=======

India's population of over 1.3 billion people suffers from acute
challenges in traditional and digital literacy. To address this gap and
enable adoption of services provides using Internet connectivity, the
Government of India started the National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM)
in 2011. The mission aims to partner with non-governmental organizations
and corporate social responsibility initiatives to deliver training
programs to a range of students, youth and adult learners. The Digital
Literacy Mission's vision is to create a multi-stakeholder consortium
that can work to showcase the transformative impact of digital literacy
on governance, employment, social inclusion and empowerment.

The NDLM seeks to complement the objectives of National Optic Fibre
Network (NOFN)---now Bharatnet\-- plan to transform every household by
educating one adult from each household in India.

Further, there is a "Digital India" initiative that seeks to transform
and digitize the Indian economy that spans various sectors, including
e-governance and financial inclusion initiatives that leverages ICTs.

Project Description
===================

Digital Village Squares are locations in rural India that are either
adjoining tower sites or at local schools, where digital literacy
training occurs. The initiative is part of American Tower Corporation's
corporate social responsibility efforts in India, and seeks to advance
the Digital India vision. American Tower partners with Hole-in-the-Wall
Education Limited and the NIIT Foundation to implement this initiative.

The sites for Digital Village Squares are carefully chosen in locations
that are central to villages. After a pilot was run in a few villages,
community buy-in proved to be a strong determinant of the success of the
program. A comprehensive mobilization plan is therefore used to create
awareness about the training and services offered at the center.
Pamphlets, skits, and sessions at the Gram Sabhas are held to reach as
many people as possible. Children enrolled in schools have also proven
to be helpful in spreading awareness about the project within their
communities. The trainers recruited for imparting digital literacy
training are all local to the areas where these Squares are located.

A sense of ownership also plays a role in whether there is increased use
of these learning stations and classes. When learning stations were
installed adjacent to tower sites, initially, there was more engagement
at those locations than in schools. Continued engagement with school
administrations to emphasize the utility of these learning stations has
led to better uptake and use. At the training classes, the National
Digital Literacy Mission's curriculum is taught over the course of 20-25
days, at the end of which an assessment of ICT skills is administered by
the trainer.

The program hopes to evolve to cover a wide range of e-governance
services and engage local entrepreneurs in key ways to maintain these
sites, as a means to enhance long-term sustainability.

Progress and Results
====================

The Digital Village Squares are presently available in 51 sites all in
rural areas, with 28 that are standalone HiWEL stations, and 23 that
offer digital literacy training using the National Digital Literacy
Mission's curriculum. The demand for training has seen a rise in these
locations, evidenced by long queues for classes at the Squares.

Challenges
==========

**Coordination challenges** **--** Selecting sites for Digital Village
Squares that are self-sustainable over the long term was a key
consideration in the deployment of this project. Sites chosen were
centrally located, either within a village or at the intersection of
villages, to enable greatest access to the local population. Neutrality
of the location was also of importance, and a conscious effort to avoid
religious and culturally sensitive sites.

**Lack of skilled manpower --** Partnerships with non-governmental
organizations to impart relevant training at these locations, and
enhance usability of interfaces to further interactive learning was
another goal that the project sought to achieve. Leveraging the right
partnerships to advance the goals of usability and ease of access has
been a challenge.

American Tower's Suggestions for Future Projects
================================================

**A sense of ownership and community buy-in is key to success of digital
literacy training programs in remote, rural areas** -- American Tower
notes the relevance of local trainers, as well as fostering community
partnerships. Sustainability of these sites over the long term can be
enhanced by locally recruiting trainers and creating partnerships within
the local community for the maintenance and use of these sites.

**Innovative outreach mechanisms** **can help** -- American Tower uses
pamphlets, skits, Gram Sabha sessions to help build a rapport with these
communities.
