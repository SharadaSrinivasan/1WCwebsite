Executive Summary 
==================

The Intel Learn Easy Steps India program works with the National Digital
Literacy Mission and a network of non-profit organizations to provide
materials to educate people in ICT skills in India since 2012. The Learn
Easy Steps modules designed by Intel have been used by 28 partner
organizations in face-to-face trainings, as well as in online education
programmes to reach over 900,000 people through face-to-face training,
including 200 physically challenged persons.

Context
=======

India's population of over 1.3 billion people suffers from acute
challenges in traditional and digital literacy. To address this gap and
enable adoption of services provides using Internet connectivity, the
Government of India started the National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM)
in 2011. The mission aims to partner with non-governmental organizations
and corporate social responsibility initiatives to deliver training
programs to a range of students, youth and adult learners. The Digital
Literacy Mission's vision is to create a multi-stakeholder consortium
that can work to showcase the transformative impact of digital literacy
on governance, employment, social inclusion and empowerment.

The NDLM seeks to complement the objectives of National Optic Fibre
Netowrk (NOFN)---now Bharatnet\-- plan to transform every household by
educating one adult from each household in India.

Project Description
===================

Intel® Learn Easy Steps, launched in April 2012, uses a curriculum
developed in India to give youth and adult learners the opportunity to
improve their social and economic self-sufficiency through digital
literacy. It teaches participants with little or no prior computer
experience, basic computer skills that are relevant to them through
activity-based cards.

The Easy Steps curriculum includes a Basic Course (with a module on
entrepreneurship); PC Basics, a computer-based tutorial; Activity Cards,
and a Help Guide (available in six languages). Currently, the course is
available in eight languages -- English, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil,
Kannada, Telegu, Marathi and Malayalam.

Partner organizations use local institutions to advertise for the
training. Pamphlets and banners are put across the village to spread
awareness about the timings and venue. Training is offered in the
following modes:

**Face to Face Training:** Intel works with more than 28 organizations
to whom the Easy Steps curriculum is provided free of cost and who
manage local implementation. The program can be adapted by the
organization partnering with Intel to customize it to their needs.

**Technology Delivered Programs:**

a.  ***Students Internet World:*** Intel collaborates with a relevant
    government department at the state level and makes available Intel®
    Learn Easy Steps resources available for download on an open
    platform. Using a scalable model, Master Trainers are trained on the
    material who in turn commit to training a certain number of students
    regularly.

b.  ***Easy Step Mobile Apps:*** Intel India launched an Android-based
    application of Intel ® Learn Easy steps. The content on the
    application is available in English, Hindi, Tamil and Gujarati.

**Alignment with Government Programs:**

a.  In Kerala, Intel collaborated with *Kudumbashree Mission*, the women
    oriented, community-based, poverty eradication mission of the
    Government of Kerala, to help its 37 lakh women members become
    digitally empowered to create sustainable livelihoods for
    themselves.

b.  Intel collaborated with the Gujarat Government through the *Gujarat
    e-saksharta Abhiyan*, the Krishi Mahotsav to empower farmers, and
    Mahila Samakhya, a nodal organization that manages women-oriented
    schemes for the marginalized to provide digital literacy. Under the
    Primary Education Department, Government of Gujarat, Mahila Samakhya
    programmes are currently being implemented in 3503 villages.
    Launched in January 2014, the program has so far equipped 500 women
    with digital literacy skills, with the objective to train another
    1000 by end of 2014.

c.  Intel has been leading the National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM),
    a consortium of industry partners, to increase digital literacy in
    the country. Easy Steps was implemented in Arain (Rajasthan),
    Noagang (Tripura) and Muthyalammapalem (Andhra Pradesh) where the
    NOFN has been rolled out on a pilot basis, to provide digital
    education and enable the people to make the most of the
    opportunities that the access to technology and the internet would
    provide.

d.  Intel associated itself with the *Department of Personnel and
    Administrative Reforms*, Government of Karnataka to train government
    officials on the Easy Steps curriculum. This will cover 44
    Departments of the Secretariat followed by around 60 Government
    Directorates and Zilla Panchayats across the state.

**Roadshow** - Under this initiative buses fully equipped with required
hardware and software and accompanied by specialists travel to various
locations equipping people with basic skills in digital literacy. This
initiative has taken place each year since 2012. Intel employees also
volunteer as trainers for the Learn Easy Steps programme.

Progress and Results
====================

Intel has trained over 200 physically challenged members on the Easy
Steps curriculum across different locations in Karnataka.

More than 22,000 students and nearly 2,000 teachers in Uttar Pradesh
benefited from the Vigyan Yatra, an initiative by the Government of
Uttar Pradesh and Intel. Earlier, in a similar initiative in Karnataka,
4,100 students attended science workshops, and 250 teachers were trained
on digital literacy.

Women have been empowered by digital literacy skills through Intel's
partnership with the Mahila Samakhya program. Many women have gone on to
become trainers themselves, which serves as an alternate source of
livelihood for them.

Challenges
==========

**Low levels of traditional literacy --**  People are often unaware of
the importance of digital education and do not opt in to take digital
literacy training. The low levels of basic literacy compounded with low
levels of ICT knowledge makes it harder for citizens to see the
relevance of technology to improve their lives. The training schedule is
hard to finalise initially due to the conflicting daily schedules of
different types of learners.

**Limited and irregular electricity access --** It is difficult to source
and maintain appropriate infrastructure in rural areas. Erratic
electricity supply is a huge challenge in the implementation of the
program, which can extend training schedules by months. The lack of
ubiquitous 2G, 3G and Wi-Fi infrastructure compounds this issues.

**Lack of affordable access--** A large percentage of the citizens
living in rural areas are daily wage earners engaged in farming, fishing
or manual labour. Attending training sessions in person is often at
great cost to them, as they may have to forego their daily wages.

Intel India's Suggestions for Future Projects
=============================================

**A 'one size fits all' approach does not work** --Partnership with key
government agencies and organizations is essential to create locally
relevant and tailored training program shows the most impact.
Adaptability in several languages can aid the uptake of a training
program among populations with low levels of traditional literacy.
