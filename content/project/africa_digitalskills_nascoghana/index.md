Executive Summary 
==================

Founded in 2012, Nasco ICT has launched a series of projects in Ghana
aimed at providing children and young people with the necessary computer
tools and skills needed to access education through information and
communications technologies (ICTs). The project installs computer
centers in local schools and provides training classes for students and
community members on computer basics and more advanced topics like web
development. The objective is to set up ICT laboratories and promote
technology literacy for students in the northern part of Ghana and other
underserved communities. Where it is not possible for the government to
provide the necessary infrastructure, their goal is to close the gap for
rural communities and provide ICT literacy.

Context
============

Ghana was the first country in Africa to be connected to the Internet.
Today, telecommunications is the main economic sector of Ghana. To
support the digitization of the economy, the government is embarking on
a digital inclusion agenda with a goal of capturing and benefiting all
citizens. They also plan to provide affordable broadband services to all
Ghanaians by 2020. According to a 2012 study by Research ICT Africa, 60
percent of the respondents answered that the high cost of access
prevented them from using the Internet. Broadband services were found to
be very expensive for most Ghanaians.

ICT has long been an emphasis in the educational development plans of
the Ministry of Education. Ghana's ICT for Accelerated Development
(ICT4AD) policy issued in 2003 has enabled a number of ICT projects and
initiatives facilitated by partnership between the public and private
sectors. Currently, the National Communication Authority has embraced TV
White Space technology to extend Internet services to rural areas,
hoping to improve teaching and learning of ICT in schools.

Civil society in Ghana also plays a role in promoting ICT in education.
An example is the partnership between KEY for Life and Young at Heart
Ghana that aims to equip children and young adults to learn better using
computers. Another example is Africa ICT Right, a nonprofit organization
with various projects related to equipping teachers with necessary
skills to integrate ICTs into their lessons, establishing computer
centers in underserved communities, and distributing low-cost
refurbished computers with open-source educational software.

Project Description
===================

The NASCO Foundation seeks to bridge the gap between the industrialized
world and Sub-Saharan Africa through information sharing and training.
It provides academic courses to support educational initiatives to
improve the lives of underprivileged communities in the Republic of
Ghana.

NASCO's courses are built according to the Ghana Education Services
curriculum, but they also have additional courses in web application and
website development. They offer evening classes and alternate schedules
to accommodate their users who are between the ages of 10 and 18.
Another project for secondary schools covers users up to age 22.

There are three extant training centers, each of which is equipped with
between 30 and 40 computers with five computers on standby for quick
replacement. Two new centers will have roughly the same -- approximately
35 computers. Four out of the five centers are located in schools, while
the remaining one is in a publically accessible community library. Only
the library is Internet equipped at present, however.

Nasco ICT purchased the technology for the pilot center, but all
remaining computers are donated or sponsored, mostly by Nibus, a Danish
civil society group. The Spanish branch of Nasco ICT sponsored them with
funding for 75 computers. The space is free, so the only cost is for the
first computers and ongoing pay for teachers. Nasco ICT sponsors two
teachers, while others are already teachers with the government
organization Ghana Education Service and they teach in the center with
Nasco ICT-provided training (where there is one teacher per center).
Students pay US\$ 3 per term for services (three terms per year).

Progress and Results
====================

Three ICT Centers have served approximately 12,200 students since 2012.
Since September 2014, the northern Ghanaian town of Sawla has a library
with computers accessed by more than 2,200 students from eight different
educational centers. The center offers free introduction to computer
science classes where users learn computer basics, both the operating
system and Microsoft Office suite of programs. The creation of the
center was possible thanks to donations and support from Nibus, Africa
Yes, Red Bull, and Labdoo. Four schools in St. Augustine use the
computer classroom to train more than 1,300 students in an area with
serious obstacles to accessing training of this type.

A 2016 assessment of student learning with the Nasco ICT system reports
an increase in test scores from 52 percent to 71 percent proficiency in
integrated science (of which ICT is a subfield). The University of Tuna,
located in the north of the country, has a computer center in its
institute where almost 2,000 students enjoy the possibility of learning
to use a personal computer (PC). The center is not only open to
students, but teachers, school employees, and the public. The creation
of the center was possible due to support from Nibus. Two new centers
launched this year and are not included.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of access to devices --** There are not enough computers for the
number of students, so they do not have individual access, which limits
learning. Often there are two or more students per computer. Students
have no prior knowledge of ICTs, and it has no continuity with their
home lives. Thus, they want to be able to offer students more time more
consistently for a faster pace of learning.

**Limited and irregular electricity access --** Electricity is already
present but it is expensive. Only one center has Internet as a pilot
project, and while the rest of them may also get electrified.

**Lack of affordable access --** Internet data is currently
prohibitively expensive.

**Community resistance** **--** Parents associate negative social
practices with Internet access, so it is a cultural shift for them to
allow their children to use the new technology.

Nasco ICT's Suggestions for Future Projects
===========================================

**Local support is key to project implementation --** The project team
highlighted how gaining support, especially from the students' parents,
in advance of implementation was very helpful. Getting financial support
has been extremely difficult, so NASCO ICT tries to get parents to
commit to giving them a venue to set up, pay the money per term, and pay
the teacher.

**Alternate funding streams are necessary for sustainability --** There
is a need for alternate funding streams within the organization. For
instance, a second Nasco project involves bee keeping as a source of
revenue for the organization's ICT program.
