Executive Summary 
==================

WoredaNet is a terrestrial and satellite-based communications network
that provides Internet connectivity and allied services such as video
conferencing and messaging to federal, regional, and woreda-level
government entities in Ethiopia. A woreda is an administrative division
in Ethiopia managed by a local government, equivalent to a district with
an average population of 100,000. WoredaNet seeks to establish a
multi-service Internet Protocol (IP)-based system using broadband and
very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) infrastructure for government
communications and e-government service delivery to citizens. WoredaNet
aspires to optimize federal and regional government administrative
efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity, and provide information on
e-government services to the public.

Context
=======

Ethiopia's e-government strategy was designed by the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology and approved in 2011. It
envisions 219 e-services delivered to citizens, businesses, and visitors
over a five-year period. Ethiopia established a justice information
system, a driver and vehicle management information system, a trade
registry system, and most significantly, a multilingual national portal
([www.ethiopia.gov.et](http://www.ethiopia.gov.et)) that links to most
governmental ministries and agencies' portals. This portal delivers
information, provides transactional services to customers, and allows
for online citizen participation.

WoredaNet is a government network that provides Internet connectivity
and services such as video conferencing to federal, regional, and more
than 611 woreda (a local government equivalent to a district) government
offices across Ethiopia, with the goal of improving administrative
efficiency and enhancing government services. The country has a sizable
ethnically, geographically, and economically diverse population of 102.4
million people (2016) with more than 83 spoken languages. It contains
nine autonomous, ethnically based entities, which are further divided
into 700 woredas and six special woredas. WoredaNet seeks to provide
services to meet great diversity and complexity that present an
administrative challenge for Ethiopia.

Project Description
===================

WoredaNet is an e-government project funded by the Federal Government of
Ethiopia and initiated and governed by the Ministry of Capacity
Building. It is implemented by the Ethiopian ICT Development Agency that
has now been consolidated into the Ministry of Communications and
Information Technology. The project builds a terrestrial and
satellite-based network to connect the lowest levels of government and
is essentially an e-administration project that is working to improve
work processes in the country's public offices.

WoredaNet seeks to deliver IP-based services through the use of
broadband terrestrial and VSAT satellite infrastructure. This forms a
part of a broader ICT initiative to promote sustainable development and
empower Ethiopians. The long-term objectives of the project include the
provision of accurate and timely information to all levels of
government, building organizational capacity at all levels of the
government, providing knowledge and information to citizens, and
bridging the digital divide between urban and rural communities. Video
conferencing allows for virtual meetings and the broadcast of recorded
sessions and programs to remote woredas, messaging services allow for
the free flow of messages through a secure network, and IP telephony
allows for voice over IP (VoIP) calls between federal, regional, and
woreda sites. Web services provide civil servants access to restricted
information, but also access to content available on the Internet on
education, health, agriculture, and governance.

The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology manages
WoredaNet through its national, regional, and woreda-level data centers.
The National Data Center centrally manages the WoredaNet, monitors and
supports the WoredaNet infrastructure, coordinates the activities of the
regional and woreda data centers, and provides maintenance and training
support. The WoredNet project installs diesel generators in
non-electrified areas and provides mentorship and operational training
for administrators in the woreda sites as well.

The VSAT central hub is at the Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation
(ETC) in Addis Ababa. The terrestrial link supports a 1 megabit per
second (Mbps) upstream data rate, while the VSAT link supports 512
kilobits per second (Kbps) in order to carry outgoing video, voice, and
application data simultaneously. The total downstream traffic capacity
is 32 Mbps shared by all the VSATs connections.

Progress and Results
====================

Video conferencing and messaging services are the most-used services
offered by WoredaNet. WoredaNet's video conferencing services for
meetings, education, training, workshops, and seminars have reached
187,000 people. Videoconferencing is also used for court hearings held
at the Federal Supreme Court, as well as regional and zone-level courts.
More than 6,445 cases have been processed via WoredaNet
videoconferenceing so far too.

WoredaNet is used to provide trainings for woreda administrators, public
servants, judges, and prosecutors. Using the video conferencing service,
the instructors at the center provide training for trainees in woreda
centers spread across the country. This practice has significantly
reduced transportation costs as a result.

The system is also used for distance education. The Ministry of Justice
has used the video conferencing system to train more than 2,000 legal
professionals in seven central woredas. Bahrdar University has used the
system to support its undergraduate distance education program by
providing tutorials to its students in seven central woredas.

The WoredaNet project has built a team of ICT experts at almost every
woreda throughout the country. More than 2,000 people have been trained
in advanced networking skills. These administrators manage the network
and provide various maintenance services to government offices.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of telecommunications infrastructure --** Many areas do not have
telecommunications service, electricity, or roads. The WoredaNet project
required a means of sending and receiving large volumes of voice, video,
and data traffic around the country, including in hyper-remote areas
beyond the reach of the ETC network.

**Challenging terrain --** Deploying networking and video conferencing
equipment at each woreda was a challenging task given the nature of
Ethiopia's terrain. A large percentage of the implementation is done in
extremely remote towns.

**Lack of skilled manpower --** Limited knowledge, experience, and
skills of ICT professionals at the woreda level posed a challenge to
successful implementation. There are not adequate human resources to
manage and operate the network in remote areas, and technical people
qualified to train others and to use the system are in short supply.
There is a lack of formal and organized digital literacy training as
well.

**Community resistance** **--** The lack of awareness about ICTs among
top political leaders is a key problem with knock-on effects. The
leadership commitment at district level significantly affected the
implementation and operation of WoredaNet services. In districts where
WoredaNet is not yet functional, the management and civil servants have
developed a sense of dissatisfaction that hampers future rollout and
galvanization efforts.

WoredaNet's Suggestions for Future Projects
===========================================

**Top-down approach has effects on take-up of e-government programs --**
The central government implemented WoredaNet without input from local
level end users, which generated resistance among personnel and led to
disregard of local applicability of the programs.

**Training raises awareness --** Access to technology influences the
knowledge and attitude toward adoption and use of technology. Need-based
and hands-on short-term trainings raised awareness among political
leaders and civil servants, and stressed the importance of being
competent vis-à-vis the use the technology.

**Management culture affects take-up --** A good management culture open
to change makes a difference with regard to the adoption of technology.
It helps overcome two major challenges by generating leadership
commitment at the top and a sense of ownership over the system toward
the bottom.

**Monitoring** **and evaluation is useful to understand implementation
impact --** Mechanisms to standardize implementation across localities,
regions, and offices and ongoing diagnostic metrics can maintain full
functionality and troubleshoot the system when necessary.
