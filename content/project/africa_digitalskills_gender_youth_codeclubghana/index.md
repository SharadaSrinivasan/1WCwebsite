Executive Summary
==================

Ghana Code Club is an initiative started in 2015 by the not-for-profit
organization Healthy Career Initiative to expose young people,
especially girls, to computing and coding. In addition to basic
information and communications technology (ICT) training, students learn
skills such as games, animation, web design, and programming. The
project was launched in underprivileged schools, but its long-term aim
is for every school in Ghana to have a coding club.

Context 
=======

Telecommunications is one of Ghana's key economic sectors with a high
affordability barrier. According to a 2012 study by Research ICT Africa,
60 percent of the respondents answered that the high cost of access
prevented them from using the Internet. The government's digital
inclusion agenda seeks to provide affordable connectivity for all
citizens by 2020.

The Ministry of Education has also emphasized the use of ICTs. Ghana's
ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) policy issued in 2003 has
enabled a great number of ICT projects and initiatives facilitated by
the partnership between the public and private sectors. The National
Communication Authority has recently embraced TV white space to extend
Internet services to rural areas as well, hoping to improve teaching and
learning of ICT in schools.

Civil society organizations in Ghana also play a role in promoting ICT
in education. For instance, KEY for Life and Young at Heart Ghana aim to
equip children and young adults to learn better using computers. Africa
ICT Right, a nonprofit organization, has various projects related to
equipping teachers with necessary skills to integrate ICT into their
lessons, establishing computer centers in underserved communities, and
distributing low-cost refurbished computers with open source educational
software.

Project Description
===================

Ghana Code Club is a not-for-profit organization that seeks to expose
all elementary school kids, especially girls, to skills in using ICTs in
Ghana. The project teaches children between the ages of 8 and 16 basic
computing skills, and how to build simple games, animations, and
websites. A team of educators moves from school-to-school to organize
after school coding sessions. They also train interested teachers to
continue the program in-house with club activities in the school. The
project provides a project guide and the materials for each session.
Club sessions are scheduled to run at least once a week and last
one-to-two hours. 

The clubs offer three modules, each of which takes an hour per week and
lasts three months. The first is a basic module, followed by modules on
the HTML and CSS programming languages.

The organization uses WhatsApp to communicate with teachers and
volunteers to facilitate communication and provide support where
necessary. The initiative covers 24 schools in Accra with students
between the ages of 8 and 14. Users between the ages of 6 and 18
additionally receive services at community centers and libraries.

The project generates some income through summer programs held during
the summer school break, but clubs generally operate through the year
and are free to users. Thirty regular volunteers and a smaller force of
rotating volunteers support the program, where much of the operating
costs pay for transportation to send volunteers to help teachers and
students. Thirty teachers are trained every three months, and the club
maintains at least one ICT teacher per school.

Progress and Results 
====================

The initiative serves 24 schools, all in the urban center of Accra. The
project is trying to partner with the government to reach more
communities with ICT centers.

The project has served more than 8,000 young people between the ages of
6 and 18. Schools reach youth between the ages of 8 and 14, and
community centers and libraries serve users between the ages of 6 to 18.
Of these 8,000, 2,500 youth have been directly instructed. The remaining
5,500 have been reached indirectly through teacher trainings in which
teachers acquire skills and then return to their home institutions to
teach their own students. Thirty teachers have been trained so far.

The organization reports that students who have completed the training
program experience better learning and achievement outcomes -- they get
better grades on average and some have won a technology challenge award.
Some students get recruited into paid positions within the Ghana Code
Club after graduation, while others join game design organizations such
as Leti Arts and others.

The project hosts an annual inter-school competition to raise awareness
and incentivize girls to pursue ICT careers. Twenty-two schools
participated in this competition in 2016 for a laptop and projector. The
project is beginning to scale up and expand nationwide to rural areas
and is awaiting permissions from the government to expand further. A
goal is to have a mobile computer lab that can move from
school-to-school to provide ICT support and training.

Challenges 
==========

**Lack of access to devices--** Eighty-five percent of Ghana's schools
lack sufficient facilities and computers, while 99 percent have no
access to the Internet at all. Public schools are extremely
under-resourced. Private schools perform better in ICT literacy simply
because their students have more access to technology.

**Community resistance** **--** As the Ghana Code Club meets after
hours, parents sometimes perceive it to be irrelevant since they already
have ICT classes during the regular school hours as part of the standard
curriculum. The club is voluntary, so many parents decide not to send
their child or children.

Ghana Code Club's Suggestions for Future Projects 
=================================================

**Creating communities such as code clubs are likely to sustain interest
in ICT skills beyond training sessions and classes --** Ghana code
club's experience has been that the experience of the community helps
build critical skills outside of mere classes and learning sessions due
to its unique pedagogical advantage and hands-on training.

**Infrastructure remains a critical challenge for long-term
sustainability --** A number of schools do not have the infrastructure
at present to sustain experiential learning in ICT skills. A mobile lab
may be an effective stopgap measure, but it is not a long-term solution
to an infrastructure problem. With a self-contained computer lab on
wheels, you can cut costs on computers and other technology. The
technology can move to where it is needed and potentially serve more
people more quickly.
