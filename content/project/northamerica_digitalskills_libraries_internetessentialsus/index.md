Executive Summary 
==================

Comcast Internet Essentials^SM^ is a high-speed broadband Internet
adoption program aimed at low-income families in the United States of
America. The program provides eligible households with connectivity for
US\$ 9.95 per month, the option to purchase an Internet-enabled laptop
for US\$ 150, and access to free online and in-person training on
Internet use. As of August 2017, the program has connected nearly 1
million families and 4 million users since its launch in 2011.

Context 
========

As of 2011, over 95 percent of people living in the United States had
access to a broadband connection of at least 4 megabits per second,
while only 62 percent had adopted a broadband Internet connection. In
addition, beginning in 2010, broadband adoption rates began to flatten
for the first time since the mid-1990s, and growth rates started to
slow. Qualitative research conducted by the Social Science Research
Council articulated a number of possible reasons that transcended
questions of mere cost and argued that demand-side of Internet access
has been woefully underexplored. This research noted that investments in
Internet proficiency are crucial to low-income communities, where large
numbers of people are faced with the prospect of Internet use for the
first time. Crucially, it also highlighted the role of anchor
institutions, such as libraries and community organizations, as
providers of training and task-based assistance for their communities.

In light of these realities, the government initiated a number of
programs to improve broadband adoption. A key finding of the 2010 Plan
was that this effort needed to be supplemented by public-private
partnerships, in order to accelerate the rate of adoption and connect
America's communities online.

Project Description
===================

Comcast uses a multi-pronged approach that combines subsidized
connectivity, access to low-cost devices, and digital training. The
Internet Essentials program is offered throughout Comcast's service
area, which includes 39 states and the District of Columbia covering 48
million households, which is 34.5 percent of the U.S. population. It
attacks multiple challenges simultaneously, as opposed to targeting just
one: Comcast partners with a low-cost laptop provider to ensure the
availability of a low-cost laptop to every family eligible for Internet
Essentials. It provides digital literacy training both online through
its bilingual site as well as through a network of over 9,000 partners
which include libraries, community organizations, and elected officials.
It also provides broadband subscriptions at a low cost of US\$ 9.95 per
month, which has remained unchanged since the launch of the program.

Comcast Internet Essentials connected its first household in August 2011
and was aimed initially at families of students who qualified for the
U.S. government-sponsored free or reduced-price lunch program. Over the
course of five years, Comcast has expanded the eligibility criteria nine
times, including schools with over 40 percent enrolled in the school
lunch program, low-income community college students, and most recently
people in public housing projects and senior citizens. To further
facilitate easy subscriptions, Comcast makes the process fully online
and optimized for mobile devices via an application. Comcast also
provides amnesty for those with past debt to Comcast and provides free
in-home Wi-Fi at no extra cost, and has increased download speeds three
times.

In terms of facilitating digital literacy training initiatives, Comcast
covers the cost of providing the materials on its bilingual site for
free to all users. As of August 2017, over 9 million users have
benefited from the website. Comcast has also spent over US\$ 300 million
in printing materials and other facilitating digital literacy training
by partner organizations and broadcast over 8.5 million public service
announcements at US\$ 110 million. A dedicated call center set up for
Internet Essentials users since 2011 has received 4.4 million phone
calls as of August 2017. Furthermore, Comcast has provided more than
US\$ 1.8 million in grants to create 14 Internet Essentials Learning
Zones in 9 states, spread across 24 cities, provided in 110 partner
organization locations. The strong investment in partnering with
multiple organizations to provide digital literacy has proven to be
critical to their outreach strategy.

Progress and Results
====================

Comcast offers Internet Essentials in 55,000 schools in 5,000 school
districts that fall within Comcast's footprint. Surveys of Internet
Essentials users indicate that over 95 percent of users have seen an
improvement in their children's grades after signing up for this
program, with over 98 percent using it for homework. A majority of
Internet Essentials users indicated that they learned about the program
from their school or local library and signed up in order to improve
educational outcomes for their family. In addition, 63 percent of
surveyed users said that the program enables creative pursuits, and 65
percent said it helps their children's reading ability. In addition, the
formal training provided by Internet Essentials has had a large impact
on digital literacy and the attainment of concrete Internet skills.

Somewhat uniquely, Comcast has collected longitudinal data to study the
impact of digital literacy training on Internet use over time. Two
consecutive studies of a sample set of Internet Essentials users in 2013
and 2014. Those who received formal training were 15 percentage points
more likely to use the Internet to look for a job, 14 percentage points
more likely to use it to access government services, and 12 percentage
points more likely to use it to connect with family and friends. Over 31
percent of Internet Essentials households reported participation in
training programs.

Internet Essentials also plays a role in helping working parents and
democratizing the benefits of workplace flexibility. The surveys report
that 63 percent of users claiming home broadband helped them to manage
their work schedules and balance family responsibilities, 48 percent
reporting that it improved their ability to communicate, and 41percent
indicating that they could work from home when necessary.

The impact of the Internet in expanding opportunities for people is also
massive. In a survey conducted in September 2014, 57 percent used the
Internet to look for a job, 55 percent used it to apply for one, and
over 65 percent expressed interest in workforce training.

Challenges
==========

**High costs:** Within the United States, the cost of broadband remains
a key consideration for people that remain offline in urban areas with
the largest disparities in income. Most users have to sign a fixed-term
contract before getting any Internet access at all, which also deters
new users. The cost of a regular Internet connection is often upwards of
US\$ 50, which makes it unaffordable for several people. Comcast
Intervnet

**Lack of skills and perceived relevance:** Unconnected communities
often do not understand how the Internet adds value to their lives, or
why it is necessary to improve their standard of living. In surveys
conducted both in the developed and A vast majority of the unconnected
do not have the skills to access the Internet in a meaningful way, which
prevents them from leveraging the Internet as a source

Comcast IE's Suggestions for Future Projects
============================================

**Digital literacy training:** Internet Essentials also believes that
training plays a key role in equipping users with the skills required to
leverage the Internet. Data from the survey shows that recipients of
formal training were 15 percentage points more likely to use the
Internet to look for a job, 14 percentage points more likely to use it
to access government services, and 12 percentage points more likely to
use it to connect with family and friends.

**Community and partner organizations**: Community organisations play a
key role in galvanizing on-the-ground support for training from within
the community. Comcast partners with 9,000 such organizations, ranging
from civil society organizations, schools, libraries, and elected
officials.

**Expanding eligibility**: Comcast Internet Essentials has also
streamlined the subscription process and expanded eligibility
requirements for Internet Essentials users, to drive broadband adoption.
Now, Internet Essentials is accessible to community college students,
seniors, public housing residents and low-income families. Expanding
eligibility requirements to more vulnerable communities has enabled more
users to access the benefits of the Internet.
