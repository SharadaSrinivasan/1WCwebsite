Executive Summary 
==================

Africa ICT Right (AIR) is a volunteer-run information and communications
technology (ICT)-oriented nongovernmental organization (NGO) established
in 2007. The organization seeks to use ICT tools to address education,
gender, youth empowerment, and health in Ghana. They partner with
donors, governmental and private institutions, NGOs, and local
communities to address the digital divide. They run integrated programs
that provide technological solutions and support to educational and
health facilities in underserved areas. Under the education vertical,
the organization runs three programs: ITeach ICT equips teachers with
skills to integrate ICTs in their lessons, Computer4Change is a
laptop-donation program, and Connecting the Unconnected consists of
building replicable ICT-equipped community centers. Mobile4Life is a
health services application, under their health program, and Girls In
Tech educates girls about basic coding skills or ICTs.

Context
=======

Telecommunications is the main economic
sector of Ghana, but costs remain a
challenge for improving Internet connectivity. According to a [*2012
study by Research ICT
Africa*](https://researchictafrica.net/publications/Evidence_for_ICT_Policy_Action/Policy_Paper_4_-_Understanding_what_is_happening_in_ICT_in_Ghana.pdf),
60 percent of the respondents said the high cost of access prevented
them from using the Internet. Broadband services are expensive for most
Ghanaians in general, which affects usage rates, but according to *Abel
Mavura from ActionAid Ghana*, women from developing countries such as
Ghana are further discriminated from accessing science, technology,
engineering, and math (STEM) fields due to the lack of infrastructure
and training, socio-economic constraints, and lack of confidence.

The government is embarking on a digital inclusion agenda to benefit all
citizens. More specifically, the government is planning to provide
affordable broadband services for all Ghanaians by 2020. The National
Communication Authority has embraced television white space (TVWS)
technology to extend Internet services to rural areas, hoping to improve
ICT teaching and learning in schools. The Accra Digital Center,
sponsored by the Ministry of Communications, was also created to promote
entrepreneurship and growth in Ghana.

Civil society and the private sector have also been active, especially
targeting the gender gap in ICT use and specialization. The Young Urban
Women Project, a partnership between Action Aid Ghana, the Northern
Sector of Action on Awareness Center (NORSAAC), and The Ark Foundation
Ghana, organized interventions like WomenOnline4Dev and Social Media for
Change to train girls and women with ICT and social media capacity.

Project Description
===================

Africa ICT Right has three projects that seek to improve ICT access in
underserved areas: Connecting the Unconnected, Mobile4Life, and Girls In
Tech.

**Connecting the unconnected** -- Started in 2007, this project locates
community centers in rural areas and provides them with computers.
Africa ICT Right set up public ICT centers for the community as digital
information hubs. This enables skill sharing among community members who
can help each other build and develop their digital skills. Services are
not free. The organization charges a small fee to cover the basic costs
of operating the centers. The cost to users is between 1 cedi (US$ 0.22)
to 50 cedis (US$ 10.99) depending on the services used. They charge 50
cedis for computer skills training. They currently operate five centers
in communities in different regions of Ghana: three in the northern
region, one in the western region, and one in the central region. A
community member that has been hired and trained manages the centers.
Moreover, AIR selects the location of centers based on the requests
received from the communities themselves.

**Mobile4Life --** The Mobile4Life project is designed to address the
fact that there is typically no communication between patient and health
center unless the patient comes to visit the health center in person.
The project was started in 2015 using an existing mobile application
called Medimobile as its platform. The application connects users to
health services, including family planning, immunization, breastfeeding,
nutrition, hygiene, and more. They avoid requiring Internet data by
using a Short Message Service (SMS) bundle. Although they aim to send
messages weekly, due to the lack of funding, they currently send
messages on a monthly basis. They are also trying to develop a hotline
service. Midwives, pregnant women, and community workers get training on
how to use the app. Community health workers can message the health
facility in advance to prepare for a patient's visit and complications.
The application also provides information to pregnant women on
nutrition, breast feeding, prenatal care and delivery. The training
lasts one week ,for two to three hours per day. The midwives are women
whose ages range from the late 20s to the late 50s.

**Girls In Tech --** This initiative is designed to equip girls with the
skills and enthusiasm necessary to pursue a career in technology. The
program serves schools in two regions: 12 schools in the western region
and 25 schools in the northern region. Roughly 50 girls in each school
are enrolled, and more than 1000 girls have participated in this
program. The program targets schools with systematically low marks in
STEM education. The program lasts one hour per week for six months, and
the services are free to students. They also train ICT teachers at the
schools, using a train-the-trainer model, and the teachers receive a
stipend. They also award the best teachers at the end of the program,
based on student performance.

Progress and Results
====================

Progress has been varied for the different initiatives and is correlated
to the operating cost of each project. Funding has been limited; costly
initiatives are harder to sustain. Currently, five communities are
served by the ICT centers of the Connecting the Unconnected project.
Mobile4Life has only just completed the pilot stage in 2017, so impact
cannot be adequately assessed yet. It currently serves two health
facilities and is used by more than 1,000 women. The pilot project was
operated at no cost to the facilities served in order to provide proof
of concept, so the project has been operating at a deficit, which has
made its full rollout difficult. Girls In Tech serves 37 schools across
two regions, and has educated more than 1,000 girls in ICT skills so
far.

Challenges
==========

**Social norms --** The major challenge of Mobile4Health is the
acceptance of this mobile application at the health center. Adoption by
health centers has proven to be a huge challenge. People are resistant
to change the services they provide, and employees are resistant to
learning new technologies. 

**Lack of perceived benefit by users--** For the Mobile4Life program, it was hard to scale the program in health centers due to health care workers not seeing the potential benefits of this new technology and paying for it. This led the organization to cancel their previous plan to charge customers in the pilot phase. The organization has devised the
strategy of charging no up-front cost for the facility center, and only
charging retroactively after the patient sees the benefit.

**Lack of funding --** The projects cannot all be realized in their
intended form due to lack of funding. For instance, programs that were
planned to operate weekly have to lapse into a monthly cycle when
resources are not available. This reduces the utility and trust in the
service when it does not deliver on its professed plan of operations.
Most funding sources do not fund direct technological interventions, but
fund broader human rights, gender, education work.

AIR's Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================

**Stable funding is required to maintain programmatic interventions in
the long term --** Demand is huge, but the resources are limited.
Adoption can be a hurdle, but projects greatly benefit from stable
funding in order to facilitate user acclimation to the services and
tools.
