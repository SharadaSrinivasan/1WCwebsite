Executive Summary 
==================

Founded in 2013, Jaguza uses information and communications technologies
(ICTs) -- such as its Livestock App -- to facilitate the sharing of
indigenous farming knowledge and enable poor farmers to obtain better
prices for their products. In addition to printed how-to guides, Jaguza
uses a variety of ICT tools, including websites, social media, blog
posts, and Short Messaging Services (SMS), Unstructured Supplementary
Service Data (USSD), and mobile, offline, and online web applications.
Jaguza's model allows farmers to easily pick up new farming methods that
can diversify and improve their yields and production. Jaguza also helps
rural farmers sell their livestock directly to growing urban and foreign
markets. There are more than 30 ethnic groups in Uganda, each with its
own indigenous farming methods, and Jaguza's model is designed to
centralize and encourage farming knowledge transfer.

Context
=======

Agriculture plays a crucial role in Uganda's economy, as it accounted
for about 23.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016, 46
percent of export earnings, and an estimated 72 percent of all Uganda's
working population, according to the Uganda Country Commercial Guide.
Agriculture income growth is one of the important factors that
contribute to the reduction of poverty in Uganda. Yet, agriculture
income growth was not driven by the adoption of modern farming
techniques and practices, according to a poverty assessment conducted by
the World Bank. Much of the land in Uganda has not been cultivated,
farmers have not utilized agricultural inputs to improve their crops,
and far fewer are using extension services. Moreover, little is known
about how Ugandan farmers find information about agriculture practices,
but there are projects that indicate the increasing use of mobile phones
among farmers.

Uganda is striving to create an enabling environment for the application
of ICTs in agriculture. The country was one of the 12 beneficiaries of
the mFarmer Initiative Fund, and the World Bank financed the country's
\$248 million Agriculture Cluster Development Project to improve
agricultural productivity, which includes an important technology
component. Lutheran World Relief Uganda, through a partnership with
Centenary Bank and the telecommunications operator Airtel, launched a
mobile group savings solution that provides a secure, convenient,
affordable, and fast way for savings and lending groups.

Project Description
===================

Many farmers in Africa rely on indigenous farming methods handed down
from generation to generation. To address this issue, Afrosoft developed
and launched Jaguza Livestock in 2017, an e-Agriculture mobile
application to improve livestock production and productivity in Uganda
and beyond. Afrosoft IT Solutions is leveraging modern technology to
build a national and eventually global central database of indigenous
farming knowledge, and then organizing farmers into a network to share
best practices from across the country. It offers a mobile monitoring
system for farmers to detect individual movements of cattle, and health
and fertility status of cattle, and was developed in tandem with
programs to raise awareness among livestock farmers regarding early
detection of livestock diseases.

Committees are formed at the village or parish level by a volunteer
community veterinarian in consultation with a local community council
chairman of the villages. The chairman is equipped with basic livestock
information concepts to raise awareness among locals and encourage them
to monitor, guide, and report any problem in the communities to the
Jaguza expert for action in real time. Consultation and dialogue with
communities help empower villagers and improve access to livestock
information through use of their mobile phone.

The system can be used online and offline, to accommodate users in areas
with limited Internet access. The offline system helps farmers in rural
communities to use the system without an Internet connection, store
their information and access it locally, and then sync he information
with the cloud server when Internet becomes available. The system acts
as central repository for information from various locations that helps
researchers, veterinarian, extension workers, and policy-makers access
information regarding their areas of interest. Livestock data and
agricultural information is collected from farmers who are linked with
relevant veterinary firms and cross-referenced with external data
gathered from the livestock laboratory, applying predictive and
analytical modules that accurately predict livestock diseases before
they spread to the rest of the farm and infect others. They send farmers
low-cost, easy-to-understand voice alerts and reminders for care
seeking, as well as actionable information and advice to help quarantine
livestock disease outbreaks. Users pay using their existing mobile
credit so that no upfront seasonal costs are necessary. The general
subscription model to have access to the complete range of services is
\$7.00 for a three-month period.

The system for detecting diseases is inserted into the animal's ear or
attached to one of its legs. The device sends data via a wireless
transceiver and uploads it to the company's central network operations
system, where it is compiled and made available to the livestock
producer via the Internet. The system has the ability to track, trace,
and monitor the health condition of individual animals in real time.
Jaguza continuously monitors using electronic ear tags to track the
movement of animals, and an alert is sent to the farmer in case the
animals move out of the mapped area, farm, sub-county, or region. This
allows livestock managers to continually monitor their animals' location
and core temperature to determine which animals might be sick, and which
others they have been in contact with.

Jaguza also has a resource center, which is a database platform offering
a wealth of animal and agricultural information, good farming practices,
and other agricultural information mainly based on livestock. In
addition, it also comes with a module for animal feed that shows how
much feed the animals consume, and helps the farmer calculate their
feeding expenditures for the animals in order to obtain profitable and
accurate results. Furthermore, it helps a farmer to market their
livestock products. Pictures are captured with a description of the
location, terms of sale, prices, contact person, etc., and uploaded to
the cloud server, where potential buyers can view all the details.

Jaguza provides extended online advisory services from veterinarians. In
this module, the farmers will also ask questions to veterinarians
online, and will be provided with answers to help them improve on the
livestock's productivity. Jaguza will help farmers, the government, and
other stakeholders map and monitor farm animals as well as the number of
livestock farmers in the particular districts with details of the
animals they have. Furthermore, users, veterinarians, and the government
will be enabled to see how a disease is distributed geographically, but
also any given animal's disease can be viewed against other information
like rainfall maps, vegetation maps, rivers, swamps, etc.

There are 85 volunteer veterinarians 89 of whom are women and 125
farmers (92 of whom are women) that have received online training. In
person training consists of one week of on-site training of the
trainers, and then those trainers conduct two-day sessions with local
farmers. Doctors who conduct trainings are compensated \$1 for each
farmer they train.

They currently serve five districts, 292 farms, 2,935 farmers, and have
been operational in the full form for 11 months. In addition to Uganda,
the project has scaled up to serve Fiji, Namibia, and Mozambique and
soon South Africa

Progress and Results
====================

The Jaguza App is currently operational in more than 40 communities
across 62 local Ugandan farms. The project targets more than 6,023
livestock farmers, with over 8,300 unique users every month, and users
are especially taking advantage of animal health data, outbreak alerts,
and educational content.

The innovation has helped rural folks access veterinary services and
locate the whereabouts of their cattle when they stray. The SMS & USSD
services, surveillance (GIS), analytics, and reporting for livestock
diseases and fertility have lead to better management of livestock and
higher productivity.

The app is improving the productivity of the farms as well. Farmers get
informed about prices, and make smarter business decision on the
agricultural market. Furthermore, there is a demonstrable reduction in
diseases, and farmers post and report their success stories.

Jaguza provides extended online advisory services from veterinarians. By
doing so, Jaguza Tech will create job opportunities among university
graduates since it has the ability to support approximately 60
veterinarians online who respond to different questions asked by
livestock farmers and guide them for higher productivity.

Jaguza has received a number of awards and recognition for their
innovative work. They won an Acia Award in 2017 from the Uganda
Communications Commission (UCC), received the Commonwealth
Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) youth innovation e-agriculture
award in 2016, and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
Telecom World Entrepreneurship Award in 2015. The Technical Centre for
Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) Africa also ranked Jaguza among
the nine-best agriculture projects in Africa in 2015, and as one of the
top 20 projects in East Africa by Ashoka Change Maker.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of telecommunications infrastructure --** There is limited ICT
infrastructure in the areas that Jaguza serves. It is necessary to make
offline capabilities a standard feature to account for the limited
availability of Internet. Backhaul connectivity is also difficult to
secure.

**Limited and irregular electricity access** -- In addition to limited
telecommunications infrastructure, the communities where Jaguza
application is deployed also have limited and irregular electricity
access. This makes access to offline tools incredibly important.

**Lack of awareness among users of ICT-based tools --** There is limited
awareness about the necessity of information to prevent talk to the
local counsel (LOC) of the village to bring awareness to the farmers,
but user adoption is still a struggle.

**Lack of sustained funding --** There is paucity of funds to rollout
most of districts, since each district need a lot of training and
awareness building activities

Jaguza's Suggestions for Future Projects
========================================

**Understanding the needs of the farmers initially is essential** --
Jaguza's success demonstrates the value of community outreach and
understanding the target audience, since one cannot merely devise a new
technology without taking their needs into account. Gaining user input
early on is a head start toward developing a useful and successful
program that centers on the needs of the target group.

**Structure of the training needs to cater to local sensitivities--** For
instance, **there** is a high degree of language diversity among the
rural populations being served. Thus, translators are needed in certain
areas. Their experience suggests communication with the user requires
being responsive to the preferred language of the farmer.

**Data collection and digital literacy training is important** -- Even
though the number of animals each farmer has is added to the platform
and helps develop the service, the farmers must still learn how they can
benefit from the program, in part, by improving their digital literacy
skills.
