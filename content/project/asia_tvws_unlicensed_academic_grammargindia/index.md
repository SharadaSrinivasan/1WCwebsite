Executive Summary 
==================

The Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay (IITB) is home to Gram
Marg, a project focused on bringing Internet connectivity to unserved
villages in India. Beginning in 2012, Gram Marg set up the first pilot
test bed that solely used TV white space (TVWS) technology to connect
seven villages in the remote district of Palghar in Maharashtra, around
100 kilometers from Mumbai. Recently, the project scaled to 25 villages
spanning approximately 350 square kilometers, and it uses an optimal mix
of wireless technologies including 5.8 gigahertz (GHz) in the unlicensed
band. This case is an example of use of innovative methods (technical,
social, and economic) such as TVWS and unlicensed spectrum to create
sustainable Wi-Fi networks in low-income areas. It also highlights the
obstacles that spectrum broadcast licenses pose to projects focused on
providing on last-mile services.

Context
============

Most broadband subscriptions in India are from digital subscriber line
(DSL) services, which are quite expensive. The remaining options are
broadband services for cellular services or Wi-Fi-based solutions. The
former is expensive and requires high levels of infrastructure, whereas
the latter have low coverage areas and slow speeds. Bringing Internet
connectivity to rural areas is especially difficult because of
cost-effective backhaul. Fiber connectivity is an example of this, which
is quite limited in India. Programs aiming to reach a specific group of
people exist, but they often exclude others for myriad reasons. The
problem lies in connecting the core network to the access network from
one region to another. This problem can be addressed with a middle-mile
network. It is a wireless network that provides coverage over a certain
radius, as a Wi-Fi zone would. This method is more stable and requires
cheaper infrastructure than direct methods of connection.

Project Description
===================

IITB's TV white space test bed arose in the context of a dearth of
broadband availability in rural areas of India. The Gram Marg team noted
that the market remained largely untapped in spite of recent government
initiatives to provide connectivity to remote areas of India and bridge
the digital divide. BharatNet, the Indian government's answer to rural
connectivity, focuses on creating optical fiber points in Gram Panchayat
(small local self-government offices).

Gram Marg notes the limitations of these access sites and proposes to
enhance and improve Internet connectivity to the small villages
themselves using TV white space. While BharatNet provides rural Internet
points of presences in centralized locations, IITB's TV white space
network extends Internet coverage by linking WiFi subnets within the
villages to these central offices. In this way, IITB has found a method
to take advantage of the particularly abundant amount of TV white space
in India in order to serve connectivity needs at very local levels.

Gram Marg also uses Village Level Entrepreneurs to build a market-based
model to sustain Internet connectivity roll out to these communities
over the long term. They provide these people with training in
maintenance, and provide costs for the network to be held.

Progress and Results
====================

IITB's TV white space project was successfully implemented in seven
villages, which then scaled to 25 villages, using an optimal mix of
technologies. The program's longevity is somewhat precarious due to
spectrum licensing issues, but the IITB team is currently researching
unlicensed methods to maintain and grow the network.

The project is transforming the way villagers manage and access their
money via ATMs set up at local kiosks. For the first time, villagers are
directly connected to a bank. The villagers are using connectivity
mostly for entertainment, communication, online government services, and
Internet bill pay.

The project demonstrates that is it possible to build a sustainable
network and a sustainable business model at once. Since the amount of
money villagers are able to save through connectivity is immense, they
are very willing to pay a monthly fee for service -- in this case, up to
US\$ 1.55 - per month.

Challenges
==========

**Licensing --** The main challenge to the project's continuance and
scalability is licensing. Currently, the project is operating on an
experimental license, issued only to those conducting scientific or
social experiments. Once the experiment comes to an end and the license
is revoked, the project will no longer have access to the licensed
spectrum.

**Accessibility --** The project has struggled with issues related to
terrain, experiencing implementation and transportation issues around
hilly areas. Moreover, the remoteness of the areas they serve means that
parts and equipment needs and replacements must be meticulously planned
to avoid waste, as there are no local stores or stock for technical
gear.

**Electricity --** The project struggled with irregular power supply in
these areas as well as the potential of project-disabling energy costs.
They have solved a great deal of these issues, however, by relying on
devices and equipment that have very low wattage.

**Community support --** The IITB team has had to put some effort into
educating the villagers about the common value and significance of the
network in order to discourage them from stealing or vandalizing
equipment.

IITB's Suggestions for Future Projects
======================================

**Taking government-funded programs to the last mile is a need of the
hour --** The Government of India is working to improve Internet access;
however, their plan -- called BharatNet -- is not as comprehensive as it
was purported to be, according to the team. IITB's project begins where
the government's leaves off, expanding the impact of the
government-sponsored fiber optic initiative.

**Community training matters --** The project notes the limitations of
providing formal training in digital literacy. They found that it was
not enough to simply inform villagers of the myriad useful ways the
Internet might improve their daily lives, mainly because this method
does not lead to adoption. Instead, lateral communication from peers
and/or first-person explorations have been major drivers of villagers'
Internet usage.
