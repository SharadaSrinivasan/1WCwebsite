Executive Summary 
==================

The Tunapanda Institute is a nonprofit organization founded in 2014.
Located in the Kibera quarter of Nairobi, the institute offers free
training programs for students between the ages of 18 to 25 in
information and communications technologies (ICTs), design, and
business. By providing residents of the city's largest slum with the
skills and equipment to qualify for entry-level jobs in tech, Tunapanda
aims to empower communities by shrinking the digital divide. It is
currently developing a project to target even younger residents with ICT
education and digital resources by building a community network to
connect Kibera's 300 schools.

Context
=======

According to the Ministry of Public Service, Youth, and Gender Affairs
of Kenya, the unemployment rate among youth in Kenya is estimated at
around 80 percent. Online jobs are expected to help resolve the
unemployment rate among the youth in the country, however, of the 80
percent of unemployed youth in Kenya, 90 percent of them lack vocational
training. As a result, the government is supporting public-private
partnerships that develop and bolster youth empowerment programs and
make them more employable.Â 

There have been several initiatives taken by the government, private
sector, and civil society to improve digital literacy skills for youth,
especially those in remote areas. One of the largest such training
programs, the Barefoot Digital Literacy Program, was initiated with
Google, Microsoft, and the national government's Ministry of Information
Communications and Telecommunications. Having facilitated by the Ajira
Digital Programme in 2016, the project aims to train 1 million youth to
be digitally literate to improve their employment likelihood.

Project Description
===================

The Tunapanda Institute's training programs were established to
supplement hard-to-access traditional education structures. Education in
East African slums and rural areas is often unaffordable or lacking in
quality. Both dropout rates and demand for educational opportunity are
high. Tunapanda provides a platform with access to educational content
geared toward 21^st^-century skills. Its content is locally sourced,
high quality, and geared toward immediate employment.

The institute is in the process of developing a larger, school-based
initiative to provide access to digital literacy and economic
opportunity. The 300 schools in Kibera will be given Internet access and
devices, and connected by a common sharing network. Teachers and school
administrators will be trained to understand and communicate the value
of ICTs to their students as well as integrate them into their learning
models. By building a platform that connects the Kibera schools,
Tunapanda hopes to change the culture of education in the city.
Currently, the schools relate to each other as competitors. Tunapanda's
network would rather shape a collaborative community in which
educational professionals in the area focus instead on the common goal
of maximizing student potential.

Tunapanda also provides other services such as market research, media
production, software and web development, and e-learning, which allows
the organization to provide free, offline, open-source educative
materials, and to run their digital literacy training free of cost.

Progress and Results
====================

As of summer 2017, the organization has trained eight cohorts, each made
up of 25 people. Typically, the institute receives more than 300
applications for each cohort, demonstrating that demand for ICT training
has been and remains high.

Of the institute's graduates, 85 percent have found employment through
the institute's placement assistance. The community network connecting
the slum's 300 schools is still in its early stages. Infrastructure is
in development, and the Internet Society is providing equipment. Funding
and Internet service provider (ISP) partners are currently being sought.

While the Tunapanda Institute is not yet directly expanding its
operations, it does actively partner with organizations looking to
replicate their projects. One such project is currently in development
in Kawangware, a smaller slum in Nairobi. Another project is running in
Kakuma, a refugee camp in northern Kenya.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of skilled manpower** -- Only one among the team running the
Institute has experience in computer networking, which poses a challenge
to swift deployments.

**Regulation** -- In Kenya, there is not yet a regulatory framework for
community networks, so Tunapanda uses unlicensed spectrum. With the
potential it has to scale, the Institute also runs the risk of being
perceived as a risk to other ISPs and be shut down.

**Lack of sustained funding** -- Tunapanda's projects have progressed
relatively slowly, as they have an entirely volunteer workforce and must
devote a lot of time and energy to fundraising.

**Community resistance** -- Kibera is a slum that has been well
accustomed to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and charity
contributions. A pay-for-service model like the one that Tunapanda is
envisaging for its schools project is unfamiliar. The institute will be
challenged in altering the community mindset from charity fatigue to
active, collaborative investment.

Tunapanda's Suggestions for Future Projects
===========================================

**Engaging local communities is useful** -- In Tunapanda's experience,
setting up effective ICT systems needs to involve the targeted
community. Tunapanda noted that its early stages involved the
institute's members coming up with ICT solutions to Kibera's problems
and then running into roadblocks as they deployed these solutions.
Tunapanda's eventual success involved prioritizing community outreach
and collaboration a major element of their development and deployment.
Brainstorming solutions in isolation from the community the solutions
are meant to aid means that these solutions are unlikely to be adopted.

**Providing local content is necessary** -- Online educational platforms
rely on local content for success. Educational quality is reliant on the
linguistic and cultural particularity of its content. Tunapanda's work
has determined that the Internet has potential in Africa, but without
robust local content, infrastructural development alone will likely not
have the desired impact.
