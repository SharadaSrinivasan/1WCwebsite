Executive Summary 
==================

Axiom is a small ISP in rural Maine, United States, which serves around
1,200 customers. Axiom is a hybrid of for-profit and non-profit
entities. The for-profit arm builds connectivity infrastructure and
sells Internet services in rural, remote, and sparsely populated regions
of Maine. The non-profit arm, Axiom Education and Training Center,
provides mandatory but free digital literacy and inclusion training
programs. Axiom leverages grants and subsidies, offers connectivity at
affordable prices through innovative technologies, and ensures that
users have the skills and knowledge to effectively use their connections
to form sustainable networks in difficult geographic, social, and
economic conditions.

 Context
========

Broadband access at acceptable speeds in the United States experiences a
substantial urban/rural divide. The Federal Communication Commission
defines acceptable speed as a minimum of 25 megabits per second (Mbps)
download speeds and 3 Mbps upload speeds. Despite efforts by the
government and private interests to close this divide, 35 percent of
people in rural areas have no Internet access, which is nearly 22
million Americans. Fiber-optic cable installation costs about US\$
30,000 a mile, which is financially unfeasible for sparsely populated
regions. Those areas are instead served by existing copper lines, which
are too weak to deliver high-speed data.

Among these unconnected areas is rural Maine, where 20,000 households
lack Internet service completely, and a considerable amount remain
underserved. The majority of Maine counties have download speeds between
7.3-10.9 Mbps, 40-60 percent below the national average of 18.2 Mbps.
Some of the reasons for Maine's weak broadband infrastructure are a high
percentage of rural areas in the state, lack of tax incentives for
network improvement, an aging population, and an inadequate
understanding of the benefits of high-speed Internet access. Also,
unlike many other U.S. states, Maine does not offer tax breaks or
subsidies for network improvement in market failure areas.

Project Description
===================

Axiom's most recent initiative is a pilot project that serves 40
customers in Indian Township, a remote stretch of tribal land in
Washington Country, Maine. This area was unserved by Internet service
providers (ISPs) as it is sparsely populated by low-income residents and
heavily forested.

With a grant of US\$ 72,000 from Microsoft's Affordable Access
Initiative, Axiom deployed TV white space (TVWS) technology in order to
bring connectivity to the area. TVWS is a new and relatively inexpensive
technology that does not require line-of-sight. Microsoft's grant
subsidized costs that profitability prospects would have made untenable.

Axiom charges users US\$ 9.99/month for their first year of
connectivity. They also mandate digital literacy training through their
non-profit education partner, Adaptrum. By pairing low-cost Internet
access with user-specific training programs, Axiom ensures that
customers are able to use their connections effectively and to their
advantage. After the first year, the price of connectivity will rise to
US\$ 39.99, at which time Axiom projects that customers will have a more
robust understanding of the value of their access to the Internet.

Progress and Results
====================

Axiom's nonprofit arm was started in 2014. Since then, they have trained
more than 5,000 adult learners in Washington Country, Maine, to better
utilize the Internet. Generally, in rural America, incomes are lower,
education is less prevalent, jobs are scarce or homogenous in industry,
and social isolation is common. Internet connections are key to helping
people in these areas participate in a culture and an economy reliant on
digital technologies.

Axiom reports success in "closing the homework gap." When school
assignments require online work, children without Internet access at
home are at a disadvantage. A student who might have needed to travel 30
minutes to the town's library to do their homework -- or not be able to
do it at all -- now has access at home due to the Axiom deployment.

In these remote areas, telemedicine helps save people time and money. A
patient with a pacemaker used to have to drive up to an hour to the
nearest clinic to have their device monitored. With connectivity, they
can now talk to a doctor from their home and have the data from their
heart monitored remotely via the Internet.

Challenges
==========

**Challenging terrain** -- The areas Axiom serves are heavily forested,
remote, and sparsely populated areas of Maine. In addition, the weather
is a factor that needs careful consideration. Maine has extremely cold
winters with large volumes of snowfall, which poses obstacles to
installation and equipment maintenance.

**High equipment prices** -- Even when the price of Internet service is
made affordable, people in the areas Axiom serves often have trouble
being able to afford Internet-capable devices. In order to meet this
need, Axiom sells low-cost, refurbished computers to people who
otherwise would not have been able to purchase a device.

Axiom's Suggestions for Future Projects
=======================================

**Subsidies can help provide initial connectivity in rural areas** --
Subsidies, such as the grant Axiom received from Microsoft, are useful
in order to expand Internet infrastructure into remote areas such as
those in Maine. Without the prospect of exceeding operational costs,
ISPs have little incentive to provide these much-needed services in
these areas.

**Affordable access with digital literacy training helps** -- Axiom's
experience suggests that digital literacy training is complementary to
affordable, low-cost connectivity. By discounting services and devices,
Axiom is able to introduce people to the Internet so that they are able
to organically cultivate their own interest and place in the information
society.

**Local partnerships are useful** -- Axiom works with local institutions
such as local libraries, and works to ensure that the library's opening
hours are suitable for a local working population to access services and
discover how they can benefit from the Internet. When the specific
social needs of a particular population are first descriptively
identified -- job opportunities, education quality, and diversity --
then a connectivity provider can better target the requirements of the
area as well as ensure future subscriptions.
