Executive Summary 
==================

Soweto Wireless User Group (SOWUG), is a nonprofit organization based in
Johannesburg, South Africa. The organization seeks to erode the digital
divide in Africa. They provide include digital literacy training and
deploy wireless hotspots. As of 2017, more than 1,000 people, including
50 youth and 10 businesses, have received digital literacy training. The
SOWUG has also deployed upwards of 20 free, public hotspots. SOWUG is an
example of a solution for accessibility and ICT familiarity in
underserviced communities that is constrained by funding.

Context
============

Soweto, originally a collection of settlements on Johannesburg's
outskirts, is now a township with a population of almost 1.3 million.
Internet access in the province is uneven. While the province is home to
80 percent of South Africa's 2,100 Wi-Fi hotspots, these are located
within Johannesburg and not in Soweto, even though it is one of the most
densely populated areas in the whole country.

A majority of households use mobile devices to connect to the Internet.
With an eye toward developing better broadband infrastructure, the
government's "South Africa Connect" project has set two target goals: 90
percent of the South African population should receive Internet at 5
megabits per second (Mbps) and 50 percent of the country's population
should connect at average speeds of almost 100 Mbps. The Municipality of
Johannesburg has plans to install 1,000 Wi-Fi hotspots and is
contemplating a 900-kilometer-wide network for households. This
deployment will not necessarily aid those in rural areas, however.

Project Description
===================

Soweto Wireless User Group aims to increase access, digital literacy,
and familiarity with information and communications technologies (ICTs)
in the Soweto region of South Africa since 2010. Due to illiteracy
within the constituency, they first offered digital literacy training
within the community. Their first activity involved creating a two-month
course via Internet modules that individuals could engage with at a
public library. However, the SOWUG noticed that retention rates for the
program were a problem, as many people dropped out.

In 2015, SOWUG obtained an office where it began offering grassroots
trainings that have been extremely successful. They have trained more
than 1,000 individuals and groups, including 10 businesses, 10
households, and 50 youth. In addition to digital literacy, SOWUG also
focuses on deploying Wi-Fi hotspots in Soweto. Using a fiber-connected
high-site tower, SOWUG uses point-to-point 5.8 gigahertz (GHz) radios
for middle mile and deploys Wi-Fi in the last mile. For backhaul, Dark
Fiber Africa paid the initial setup fee of 12,000 rand (US\$ 858.90) and
the monthly fee of 6,500 rand. In 2014, the Foundation for Internet
Development provided backhaul support for a year. In addition, the
Internet Society (ISOC) donated 100,000 rand (US\$ 8100) that SOWUG has
used for cybersecurity.

Maintenance of the network costs around 25,000 rand (US\$ 2000) a month,
and SOWUG estimates that 2 million rand (US\$ 161920) more is necessary
to extend the network. They have plans to rollout 100 Wi-Fi sites in
Soweto and have entered into a partnership with the government of
Johannesburg to implement this plan. Even with the high costs, SOWUG
provides users with 500 megabytes (MB) of data per month for free for
users willing to set up profiles.

Progress and Results
====================

SOWUG hotspots serve approximately 1,000 devices with 150 simultaneous
daily connections. Many users use multiple devices to access Wi-Fi.
Ninety-three percent of users have utilized the hotspots over computer,
52 percent have used the network on their mobile phones, and 25 percent
of users have connected on tablets.

SOWUG has provided digital literacy training to more than 1,000
individuals, which includes 10 businesses, 10 households, and 50 youth
community members. Users at the SOWUG office use the Internet for a
variety of tasks, such as writing a résumé, job searching, email,
research, taking webinars, and viewing talks by distinguished
individuals.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of access to devices ­--** SOWUG's endeavors are impeded by a
lack of access to equipment. The radios that SOWUG relies on for their
deployment are not available locally either since the nearest retailer
is more than 60 km away.

**High cost of deployment** -- In addition to the expensive licensing
requirements, other costs also make network expansion difficult. The
rents for the deployment locations, for instance, are constantly rising,
and the Internet in the area is extremely expensive. Prices currently
stand at approximately 150 rand for 1 gigabyte (GB). Finally, SOWUG is
not available to use all the bandwidth that has been donated, as they
cannot currently afford more access points. Further, due to the low
penetration of relevant ICT and technical skills available locally,
SOWUG is heavily reliant on outsourced labor.

**Regulation --** South African government regulations require SOWUG to
obtain a "public license" for their network. This license costs 30,000
rand, and it must be regularly renewed.

**Lack of digital skills --** On the user side, digital literacy was so
low that SOWUG needed to provide training before the hotspots would be
useful.

SOWUG's Suggestions for Future Projects
=======================================

**Cultivating partnerships is useful --** SOWUG has been masterful at
connecting with corporate and nonprofit partners to fund their
initiatives. This has provided them both with funding as well as
materials and resources to enact their projects. Yet, funding remains an
issue, which limits their ability to scale.
