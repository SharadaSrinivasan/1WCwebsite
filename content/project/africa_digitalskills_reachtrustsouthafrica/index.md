Executive Summary 
==================

The Reach Trust was established in 2012 to inspire and improve lives of
low-income communities in South Africa through the development of
innovative and cost-effective mobile solutions. Their mobile-first
solutions are designed to cost-effectively enable the transition from a
resource-based to a knowledge-based economy, while focusing on three
priority areas to improve lives through education: parenting, student
education, and youth employment. They have developed targeted programs
to address each of these areas: CareUp, LevelUp, and MoveUp. To date,
they have helped more than 10 million people transform their lives
through access to free education, health, and counseling services on
their mobile phones. They work in partnership with governments, the
private sector, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), communities, and
leaders around the world who support programs for cost-effective social
change.

Context
=======

The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) estimated that 98.96 percent of people between the ages of 15
to 24 were literate in 2015, but the 2016 Research on Socioeconomic
Policy brief showed that 58 percent of Grade 4 learners in South Africa
could not read for meaning, while 29 percent are completely illiterate.
The quality of education in South Africa has been lamented by many
researchers, policy-makers, and concerned citizens.

The high cost of labor, low skills, difficulty job searching, and
persistently low employment outcomes are some of the barriers for South
African youth to securing employment. The challenging job search is
related to the fact that poor youth cannot afford or are incapable of
using the Internet to search for jobs or postsecondary education
opportunities, and it is difficult for them to leverage their social
network.

The South African government and other organizations have been striving
to address youth unemployment issues through various programs. The
National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) is an agency established in
2008 that is operating the National Youth Service (NYS) program, which
tackles youth unemployment. The Fit for Life, Fit for Work program
provides young people with a comprehensive program that offers life
skills and work-related skills training, and job search assistance, with
a 80 percent success rate. Additionally, the Harambee Youth Employment
Accelerator project takes a different approach by advocating employers
practice inclusive recruitment that focuses on young people.

Project Description
===================

The Reach Trust currently has 12 full-time employees and three main
initiatives: CareUp, LevelUp, and MoveUp.

**CareUp--** Developed in association with the Western Cape Department
of Social Development and The Innovation Edge in 2016, CareUp breaks
down the complexity of parenting into small steps that are easy to
achieve. CareUp is available as an Android app and mobile site. It helps
to improve early childhood development (ECD) through regular messaging
and push notifications with bite-size ECD content linked to activities,
instructions, and exercises that supports children's mother tongue
language development. The content is sourced from Wordworks's *Every
Word Counts* books and provide parents and practitioners with the tools
they need to teach young children to read and converse. Parents and
practitioners receive three weekly messages with activities and
instructions around a theme that is aligned to the National Curriculum
Framework. In addition, they also receive weekly inspirational content,
and can access a resource section that includes a selection of stories
from Nal'iBali, a national reading-for-enjoyment campaign to spark
children's potential through storytelling, to read to children at any
time. They conduct two-hour-long training sessions at schools for
parents for CareUp in which they show them how to use the app and
provide some basic digital literacy for parents and teachers.

**LevelUp --** Level Up aims to encourage learners to increase their
learning time outside of the classroom through regular engagement with
educational content in the form of bite-sized daily interactions. The
system measures the performance of learners in these interactions and
they are awarded points. These points can then be used to unlock a
variety of real world rewards. The program targets high school students
for incentivized learning. Learners take quizzes for points, and earned
points can be redeemed in a rewards store for things like groceries and
other essentials. Unlike most e-learning and mLearning products and
services on the market, LevelUp provides learners with access to
psycho-social support, and inspirational career advice free of charge.
Educational learning material is presented in a mobile friendly format
with contextual references to make it meaningful and relevant to
learners. Although LevelUp is available on virtually any mobile phone,
it was built for the future, with the main focus being on the Android
operating system.

**MoveUp --** MoveUp is a free mobile application that affordably helps
young people learn new skills and build a performance-based résumé. The
Reach Trust believes that there is a significant opportunity to disrupt
the status quo and unlock substantial value and savings for young
work-seekers through a cost-effective and scalable mobile technology
solution. MoveUp targets unemployed youth, especially school dropouts,
between the ages of 18 and 25. It offers tutorials on particular work
opportunities and career paths, as well as on practical employment
seeking skills like building a résumé. Micro courses allow users to
learn entry-level jobs skills, and build successful behaviors through
small, focused steps. MoveUp's built-in résumé generator automatically
captures everything that a user learns and achieves on the platform on
their SmartCV. They can easily share their SmartCV online, or download
and print it.

A range of sources including the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), Innovation Edge, the Government of the Western Cape, corporate
social responsibility funding, and private donations funds Reach Trust.
They are considering introducing a short curriculum for early childhood
that would include a small fee to generate some revenue, but the project
generally is a donation and grant-funded nonprofit.

Progress and Results
====================

CareUp is available in Xhosa, English, and Afrikaans, and was piloted in
the Western Cape at 10 locations with 15 practitioners and 120 parents
between August and December 2016. The results of the pilot have been
very encouraging, especially in terms of parents reading to their
children. As such, CareUp will be piloted at 50 additional sites in
2018, and will soon be available in Zulu as well. 

Since its launch in February 2016, more than 150,000 unique users have
engaged with LevelUp, completing more than 750,000 learning exercises.
Key performance metrics, such as a significant increase in weekly
engagement, confirm the potential of LevelUp to reach and retain users
through mLearning. 

Reach launched the minimum viable product to validate use-case
assumptions in February 2017. To this end, they will trial rapid product
iterations with randomized user groups in the Western Cape over a
10-month period. Concurrently, they plan to develop and implement
further product enhancements, including localization (specifically
language options), talent analytics, and job matching. It has been
implemented in four schools as of early 2018.

Plans for expanding the project include a new math application for
teachers called MathsUp that is currently being piloted in the rural
area of the Eastern Cape. That was launched on 1 October 2017, and they
are waiting to gather more data before further expanding the program.
Another application in development is focused on reusing recycled
materials. Content is designed for a certain grade level, but students
in that grade are not up to speed; thus, pushing content appropriate for
the proficiency level students are currently at is a struggle that
requires extensive data and analysis.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of affordable access --** Low-income and under-resourced target
users are reluctant to interact with content that will cost them money,
either directly or indirectly because of the cost of the Internet use in
general.

**Community resistance --** Parents assume schools educate their
children, so they do not see why they should be involved in educating
their child further. In order to get them to interact with content that
can help them, they have to first be convinced that it is relevant to
them at all.

**Technological obsolescence** -- Many people have Android smartphones
that are using outdated versions of the operating systems, which cannot
support the mobile applications that the projects rely upon.

Reach Trust's Suggestions for Future Projects
=============================================

**Understand your audience is essential to creating useful experiences
--** Initiatives would benefit from being tailored not just to the local
communities and their needs, but also to their favored technologies and
ways of access. Users may have variable literacies in different streams
of access, so they need to be catered to developing their strengths as
well as eliminating their weaknesses. Not all iconography signifies in
the same way across communities either; adopting colors and symbols in
an informed way that is responsive to local signifying regimes is
helpful at helping the content and program make sense to the users.
