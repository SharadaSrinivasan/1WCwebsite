Executive Summary
==================

The Vanuatu Inter-Island Telemedicine and Learning (VITAL) Network
Project began in the geographically isolated and remote village of
Naviso on Maewo Island. A community with no cellular network
successfully advocated for Internet access to communicate with doctors
at a hospital in Luganville, on Santo Island. Leveraging a
multi-stakeholder approach, in less than six months, two villages have
engaged with doctors over 1,250 times and have helped 32 patients. This
includes six life-threatening cases involving mothers and children, and
ten patients who would have been permanently disabled without
intervention.

Context
=======

Vanuatu is a linguistically and culturally diverse island nation with
rugged terrain separating villages on each of its 65 inhabited islands.
This geographic isolation leads to a lack of timely health data
reporting back to the government, in the cases it can be captured at
all.

Vanuatu ranks 125th of 187 countries on the Human Development Index,
with high maternal and infant mortality rates. Inter-island travel is
prohibitively expensive and at times impossible owing to weather and
infrequent transport. Telemedicine is therefore a natural choice to help
meet the healthcare needs of its population

Project Description 
===================

VITAL harnessed the efforts made by the local communities of Maewo
Island to provide Internet connectivity to their villages. The Vanuatu
Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) and the
office of the Telecommunications and Radiocommunications Regulator (TRR)
offered free technical assistance and support. Kacific Broadband
Satellites provides satellite internet connectivity for the communities
in order to facilitate telemedicine and eHealth.

While researching solutions for the communities' expressed need to
access telecommunications for healthcare, they worked with myriad people
and organizations in order to design and implement the project. They
developed partnerships with a United States Peace Corps Volunteer, and
then expanded to reach out to India's Aravind Eye Care System,
researchers at the University of Michigan, and network engineers in New
Zealand and Australia. Government and non-governmental agencies within
Vanuatu offered resources, expertise and advice, and partnered directly
with the communities to implement an effective communication system for
healthcare workers at all levels.

The community successfully fundraised and paid for all installation fees
as well as carried the equipment to site using the only means of
transport available: by foot-path, over a mountain, carrying the
equipment on their backs.

The goal of VITAL is to connect primary healthcare workers on Maewo, a
remote island in Vanuatu, to doctors at the Luganville referral hospital
located on Santo Island, via the internet. A partnership between the
communities and the Government of Vanuatu enabled this goal. High-speed
Internet connectivity facilitates video conferencing between doctors and
primary healthcare workers, which enables speedy diagnosis and care for
islanders. Since the launch of the project in October 2016, primary
healthcare workers have been trained to use solar-powered tablets and
have improved health outcomes through over 1250 interactions to solve
routine and life-threatening cases alike.

Progress and Results 
====================

VITAL provided essential medical advice to help care for 32 patients
including six life-threatening cases involving mothers and children.
These numbers, when viewed in the context of the project which covered
half the island's total population of 3,569 people are significant wins
that the project has achieved in the last six months.

Despite no digital literacy, primary healthcare workers were trained in
three days to use a tablet to initiate a video conference via the
Internet with a doctor at the referral hospital. With little supervision
and prompting, communications rose over 1000%. A Facebook group
conversation included all the remote health workers in the connected
areas to three doctors from the referral hospital who helped handle
cases. The Facebook platform integrated in their daily routines and has
been utilised over a 1,000 times. Emojis were used to convey emotion and
feelings of the health staff as they interacted.

One of the patients who was helped using the VITAL network was a child
under five with severe diarrhea and acute malnutrition. This was a
life-threatening case, but telemedicine services enabled the doctor to
guide the nurse and continuously monitor progress until the diarrhea
ended and the child was stable and regained his strength through
adequate nourishment.

Through the course of the VITAL Project, 56 per cent of the patients
served were female. In addition, women in Vanuatu do not have financial
autonomy. The gendered economic disparity makes it more difficult for
women to access financial resources or convince patriarchs to spend
money on healthcare, especially as transportation costs for expert care
at a nearby urban center can be cost prohibitive. Through the VITAL
network, specialists can provide localised care that lowers financial
burdens. This helps to close the gap between men and women in their
ability to access care.

Challenges
==========

**Technological challenges --** Finding an application specific to the
needs of the community for telemedicine proved to be difficult. The
application selected for the project was a Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant messenger and video telehealth
platform. While in theory the application should have worked, it did not
load effectively on the available satellite network connection in the
two villages. The project managers chose to implement Skype in the
interim while working with a developer to address the problem. The
healthcare workers naturally gravitated to Facebook as a means of
communication upon deployment of the project.

**Socioeconomic factors** -- A lack of trust in the national healthcare
system influenced patients' receptiveness to health resources and
medical recommendations. There were two specific cases in implementing
this program where limited financial means and fear of the healthcare
system proved significant hurdles for patients.

VITAL's Suggestions for Future Projects 
=======================================

**Expertise-strapped island nations like Vanuatu can more equitably
serve their populations by utilising telemedicine services** -- ICT
Applications can be an affordable and sustainable way to support
development in health. Through effective training in ICTs, VITAL team
members were able to provide expedient and effective healthcare to
remote communities while maintaining patient trust and privacy. Rural
healthcare workers had access to specialists who provided remote
diagnosis, continuing education, and constructive feedback. Typically,
remote nurses, nurse aids, and village health workers have very little
on-ground support for medical care in extremely challenging situations.

**Careful analysis of the VITAL Project is enabling data-driven decision
making to expand ICT utilization to improve health outcomes** -- VITAL
seeks to leverage experience and evidence-based analysis to affordably
and sustainably expand access to healthcare so that no remote place
suffers from preventable deaths and disability, or primary healthcare
worker burnout due to lack of adequate resources.
