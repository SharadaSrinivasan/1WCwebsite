Executive Summary 
==================

Project Tawasol is a project in Tunisia that's led by IEEE Sight,
Tunisia chapter and People Centered Internet. The project connects
primary schools across the country to the Internet, and train students
to use the Internet through ICT skills workshops conducted by IEEE SIGHT
members. The project aims to create an Internet-aware next generation by
sensitizing youth to critical skills. The project launched in 2016, and
connected a primary school in Tunis -- Sadiki school -- in 2017.

Context
=======

Internet penetration in Tunisia stood at 46 percent in 2014, according
to the International Telecommunications Union. A predominant majority of
the population accesses the Internet through mobile broadband
subscriptions, with more than 4.5 million subscriptions to 3G mobile
data plans which far exceeds the number of fixed broadband subscribers,
around 500,000 in number.

In the government's official 2002-2007 policy, Reconstruction of the
Tunisian Educational System, ICTs are emphasized as necessary. The
Educational Act states that the Ministry of Education and Training and
the Ministry of Higher Education should implement policies related to
education, including those that pertain directly to the use and
proliferation of ICTs for varied purposes. The policy emphasizes the
importance of ICT to equip schools, introduce ICT as a subject and prove
teacher training. As a step towards these goals, a virtual university
and education system was initiated in Tunisia in 2002, without much
success in the decade that followed.

As of 2016, 48% of the schools in Tunisia have access to an Internet
connection. However, not all of these schools are equipped with labs
that can train these children with ICT skills, and connections are more
often than not provided to the administrative staff for coordination
purposes.

Project Description
===================

Project Tawasol seeks to provide students small Raspberry Pi operated
devices with hard disks that can be updated periodically with relevant
content such as Wikipedia pages, TED Talks and other educational content
from the Internet. The devices have been developed by IEEE Sight in
Tunisia with aid from the San Francisco chapter. They are capable of
automatically updating content when connected to Wi-Fi or 3G networks.

Tawasol invests in youth, technology and STEM education to empower
problem solving and connections between students. They aspire to connect
people by the provision of adequate infrastructure and constructing an
education and social change process that fosters interaction between
communities.

In December 2016, the Sadiki school in Tunis was identified as the first
"Connected School" for the dissemination of these devices coupled with
digital literacy training workshops by members of IEEE Sight. With
support from the government, the project aims to connect 24 such schools
-- one school in each region within Tunisia. The project focuses on
primary schools, with an aim to make the next generation aware of new
technologies and information that can be accessed through the Internet.

As part of the project, technical talks and digital literacy as well as
ICT training workshops are organized by IEEE Sight, Tunisia. These talks
cover interactive sessions that teach students how to build their own
websites using drag and drop interfaces. The first workshop conducted in
2016 had a 50% participation by women, a key step in enabling gender
parity in Internet access and skills.

Progress and Results
====================

In digital literacy training workshops that have been conducted by IEEE
Sight, students have built their own prototype websites such as a school
blog using HTML, CSS and modular website building interfaces. The
reactions in post-workshop surveys conducted thus far have been
tremendously positive. "Most students asked us when we will return to
provide them with their own devices for development," says Skander
Mansouri, one of the IEEE Sight members that conducted these training
workshops.

The project has goals to impact rural schools in every part of Tunisia
through the provisioning of low-cost Wi-Fi enabled Raspberry Pi operated
devices, and has already impacted close nearly a 1000 students overall.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of access to devices --** Most schools in Tunisia do not have
computer labs that have Internet enabled devices, which forms the first
barrier to students that are trying to use the Internet. With low rates
of home broadband connectivity in rural areas, schools and community
anchor institutions are crucial points of contact for connecting to the
Internet.

**Lack of skilled manpower --** ICT training is introduced at the higher
secondary level, at the age of sixteen. Most students are unable to
harness the resources Internet offers to them prior to that. Training of
teachers in the latest technology as well as updation of skills is very
poor, which is another challenge to digital literacy education.

**Lack of Internet** **access:** Rural areas suffer most from the lack
of Internet connectivity. While coastal areas have relatively high rates
of home broadband subscribers, schools still lag behind. Most homes
still depend on copper, and while fiber connectivity is available to
large enterprise, it is still out of reach for most households. In rural
areas, wireless connectivity is restricted to 2G networks, whose
coverage is very poor in remote areas in the interior regions of
Tunisia.

IEEE SIGHT's Suggestions for Future Projects
============================================

**Providing primary school connectivity can be an important enabler of
education and opportunities for young students** -- IEEE SIGHT's
Raspberry Pi devices provide access to the vast troves of information
that is available on the Internet, at a very low cost. This enables
educational opportunities for thousands of primary school students.

**ICT Skills training is a crucial component of connectivity projects
targeted at youth and needs to incorporate real-world relevance** --
This training is more successful when conducted in an interactive
setting and aimed at achieving an output (such as a website).
