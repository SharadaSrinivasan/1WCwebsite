Executive Summary  
==================

Medha is a not-for-profit social enterprise that seeks to improve
employment outcomes for youth in under-resourced colleges in India.
Medha provides skills training to students in the form of basic
information and communications technology (ICT) and digital literacy
training, alongside career counseling, support, and workplace exposure.
The program is designed to prepare students to secure and excel in their
first job. Medha's training includes 30-60 hours of in-class instruction
and activities, and 150 hours of on-the-job training across three
advancement programs. The programs include a Career Advancement Bootcamp
(CAB), Life-skills Advancement Bootcamp (LAB), and Technical Advancement
Bootcamp (TAB). TAB focuses specifically on digital literacy, which
includes training in the use of computers, data entry, as well as
programs and applications used in the workplace. Medha currently serves
six districts in Uttar Pradesh, but has plans for expansion.

Context 
=======

A stark skills gap exists among Indian youth, crippling a number of them
from accessing jobs in a burgeoning industry that serves as a provider
of ICT services to companies around the world. A low literacy rate and
the education system's inability to adapt to dynamic industry needs also
contribute to youth's unevenly distributed digital literacy skills.
Students' ICT skills proficiency is correlated with geographic proximity
to urban areas, proficiency in English, as well as level of educational
attainment.

The Government of India has initiated schemes such as the National
Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) with the goal of making at least one
person per household digitally literate, and the Pradhan Mantri Gramin
Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA) program aimed at training 60
million rural households by March 2019. Training for youth has also been
provided by nonprofit organizations such as ICT Academy, or companies
like the DXC India.

Project Description 
===================

Headquartered in the state capital of Lucknow, Medha offers its
signature instruction in skills training by conducting programs for
college youth at their campuses. Their Technical Advancement Bootcamp
includes basic digital literacy skills such as data entry, operating a
computer, and proficiency in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The
boot camp extends for 60 hours with sessions lasting either one or two
hours per day, and it takes about two months to complete. The bootcamps
feature around 25 students in each class.

Medha targets students in colleges that are rated by the government as
being under-resourced. When the college's lab is not functional or
cannot sustain 25 students, Medha augments available resources with its
own computers.

TAB costs 500 Indian Rupees (US\$7.85) per student for the full 60 hours
of training. Some colleges subsidize this training by choosing to pay an
hourly rate of 150 Indian rupees for the instructor's time. The area
manager negotiates college rates on a case-by-case basis. The fee is a
mechanism to generate student commitment to the program, raise
attendance rates, and prevent attrition.

Medha currently serves six districts in Uttar Pradesh. It trains
students at 35 institutions, has a strong cohort of 3,000 alumni, and
admits 150 new students each year.

Some of the colleges Medha works with are women-only, which leads to a
greater participation by women in their cohorts. This, while not a
specific target for Medha, is a welcomed side effect.

Certified Medha students must attend at least 75 percent of the course,
and once students complete the program, they qualify for a variety of
alumni benefits. Medha supports its alumni in preparation for entrance
exams for government jobs that offer pensions, job security, and other
benefits.

Medha claims that their program has outpaced other digital literacy
programs due to four critical reasons. First, it is offered at college
campuses. Second, it is more affordable and not time consuming. Third,
it focuses on experiential learning. And finally, it shows a clear path
to success in the form of additional support with securing internships
and jobs.

Progress and Results 
====================

Leading global foundations such as the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation,
Citi Foundation, and EdelGive Foundation support Medha. It has received
numerous awards for its work, including the Echoing Green Global
Fellowship, the Dasra Girl Power Award, and the Sitaram Rao Livelihoods
Asia Award.

Since 2011, Medha has trained more than 3,000 students across 35
educational institutions, placed them into internships and full-time
jobs with 200 leading employers, and built a public-private partnership
with the Government of Uttar Pradesh to employ qualified graduates.

Medha works to close the gender gap in digital literacy and employment
by developing tailored solutions for women and girls. They set up
work-from-home alternatives for women so that women can access
opportunities without contravening their parents or fighting social
constraints placed on women working outside the home.

Medha conducts extensive surveys of alumni regarding job satisfaction
and job qualification, and provides support on a continuing basis to
alumni. Initially, Medha observed a low 25 percent response rate to its
surveys, which prompted efforts to build stronger ties to alumni. Medha
measures its own impact across its three programs according to:
employment, employability, and life skills. Those parts of the digital
literacy training are assessed only according to the metrics of
employment and employability.

Medha made efforts to get its own program Intel-certified, as Intel
India also deploys digital literacy training. Intel's program, however,
is not just for college-going students, but for the general public.
Medha chose some elements of Intel's program and integrated them into
their own program, and had its trainers instructed by a master trainer
from Intel. Medha trainers were certified by Intel to train their own
students in June 2017.

Medha has plans to scale up the project. They plan to grow to 20,000
students over the next three-to-five years, and to expand across
three-to-five more states in India.

Challenges 
==========

**Limited and irregular electricity access --** The colleges they serve
have inconsistent electricity. Not all colleges have Internet
connectivity, and of those that do, not all have consistent
connectivity.

**Lack of access to devices --** Under-resourced colleges do not have
the necessary ICT infrastructure. The ICT lab is not fully functional,
or is not adequately resourced with sufficient computers to sustain a
class of 25 students.

**Limited instruction hours --** The program is only 60 hours, which is
not as long as the comparable Intel program, for instance, because they
have to work with the constraints of the college schedule and campus
availability.

**Social norms --** Parental and societal expectations regarding
appropriate conduct for girls and women prevent them from taking
internships and jobs for which they are qualified because they are
discouraged from working outside the home.

Medha's Suggestions for Future Projects 
=======================================

**Impact assessments are necessary --** Medha compares their internal
impact assessments to data collected by third parties to get a more
complete and objective sense of the impact of the project in the real
world. Long-term tracking of alumni helps assess impact more
realistically, and generates local champions in remote areas and areas
in need. Alumni help as mentors (both in training, and in a more diffuse
professional network) for incoming Medha students.

**Full-time instructors are preferable to part-time alternatives --**
Medha initially hired freelance trainers but had trouble with quality
control and instructor commitment to students, necessitating a switch to
a full-time trainer model. A next step toward optimization might be to
train faculty of the colleges they are working with instead of bringing
in their own instructors to reduce costs and enable the project to scale
up further.

**Student retention tools must be experimented with --** Medha's model
provides training to students on campus, which cuts down commute time
and increases attendance. The project is not-for-profit and donation
based, but a nominal fee keeps students committed without putting a
financial strain on them.
