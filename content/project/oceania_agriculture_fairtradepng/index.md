Executive Summary 
==================

Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) launched a two-year project in
Papua New Guinea (PNG) to drive agricultural development and market
linkages to alleviate poverty in rural areas through agricultural
business capacity development. The project built on supply chains
developed in PNG through Fairtrade ANZ's United Nations International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)-funded "Fair trade Promotion
Project in PNG" launched in 2011. The project enabled Fairtrade ANZ to
partner with eight coffee and cocoa producing farmer cooperatives,
representing 25,000 rural farmers, to trial and give feedback on various
information and communications technology (ICT) interventions in order
to promote ICT as a catalyst for business and community development in
PNG. Selected interventions were aimed to address farmers' issues of
isolation, and poor telecommunication and power infrastructure.

Context
=======

Agriculture is the primary sector in Papua New Guinea's economy,
contributing to approximately a quarter of the gross domestic product
(GDP), according to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The sector engages
most of the labor force (the majority of which is informal), and
supplies the livelihood of 85 percent of the rural population, according
to the World Bank). Most people (87 percent) in PNG also live in rural
areas.

Although the majority of men and women work as farmers, they have to
face many challenges in creating an information network among
themselves. Some of these challenges include low mobile phone and
Internet penetration rates (47 percent and 7.9 percent in urban and
rural areas, respectively), high Internet costs, geographic challenges
due to mountainous islands, diverse cultures, and a low literacy rate
(of 63.4 percent).

The Government of PNG has strived to improve the situation. In 2007, the
government allowed Digicel, the Caribbean mobile phone company, to enter
the PNG market and compete with the state-owned company. This led to the
rapid expansion of mobile phone usage in PNG. Digicel partnered with the
Fresh Produce Development Agency to launch the Mobile Market Information
Service in October 2009 that provides market updates of fresh produce to
smallholder farmers and other players in the value chain. Additionally,
PNG's \$15 million, World Bank-funded Rural Communications Project is
being managed by the PNG National ICT Authority with the goal of
improving access to ICT infrastructure and services for the rural
population.

Project Description
===================

The project worked with eight Fairtrade farming cooperatives in PNG
across six provinces -- in the areas of Jiwaka, Western Highlands,
Eastern Highlands, Chimbu, Madang, and Morobe. Of these eight
cooperatives, seven are coffee cooperatives, and one of them is cocoa.
The project implemented mobile solar-powered charging stations in each
community and equipped the cooperatives with a suite of office supplies,
including a laptop, printer, camera, and smartphones with unlimited
closed group communication plans that facilitatedcommunication among
farmers and between farmers and buyers, suppliers, and distributors. It
also included a weekly radio program on PNG's national radio station
about Fairtrade; and training on basic computer literacy conducted by
PNG's University of Technology (UNITECH).

UNITECH developed training materials and conducted workshops on basic
technical skills. It trained 400 farmers in six villages for
three-to-four full days in basic computer literacy. In addition to ICT
support, equipment, and training, Fairtrade ANZ also created a radio
program 'Toktok Fairtrade' (Talk Fairtrade) with 24 episodes about
various Fairtrade-related topics for the national broadcasting channel
to facilitate communication among and between farmers and buyers. As of
2017, more than 25,000 people (farmers and their families) benefitted
from the project.

Implementation was supported by a number of leading partners including
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Coffee Industry
Corporation (CIC), Digicel PNG, and UNITECH, enabling greater impact
through an extended reach and shared support mechanisms.

Progress and Results
====================

Digicel, with support from the New Zealand government and the IFC,
launched a trial of solar charging stations for mobile phone users in
Papua New Guinea before the commencement of this project. The first
Digicel solar-charging station was installed at Hula, a village two
hours from the capital, Port Moresby, and was a success. Digicel has
installed close to 500 stations scattered across rural areas since,
allowing 500,000 people in isolated parts of PNG to connect with family
and friends, as well as to do business. The solar stations are partly
owned by community members in each region.

The Fairtrade ANZ project commenced in November 2013, and was completed
in June 2016. The overall goal of the IFAD-funded project was to
contribute to poverty reduction and livelihood improvement among
Fairtrade ANZ-certified and advanced pre-applicant groups in PNG by
facilitating communication among farmers, farmer groups, their
exporters, and with consumers as they build their own producer to
consumer relations. The primary aim was to support the development of
efficient and effective communication systems for the target farmer
groups so that they are able to improve their ability to conduct their
agricultural businesses.

In its first year, from November 2013 to December 2014, the project
engaged the IFC to build on its research on ICT services available in
PNG, with a focus on recommending suitable interventions for Fairtrade
ANZ's target cocoa and coffee producer groups. They built on the
partnership with IFC's Sustainable Business Advisory and Investment
Services departments, which led to greater benefits for target groups
around improved mobile coverage, solar charging stations, and solar
charging devices. Fairtrade ANZ held two stakeholder consultation
processes to ensure engagement and uptake of target groups and other
stakeholders, and conducted target group-specific analyses of
communication strengths and weaknesses as well as potential
interventions to be undertaken through the project.

In the second year, from January to October 2015, the project continued
to liaise with the IFC around Digicel services, and recommended solar
charging device distributors. They finalized the selection of trial
interventions in consultation with target groups, and finalized all
negotiations with service providers. They launched a trial period of all
ICT interventions, including initial trainings, at the Fairtrade ANZ
Stakeholders Workshop in August 2015. They provided ongoing desk support
to target groups, including identifying potential supplementary
interventions such as mobile Internet dongles and signal boosters to
extend and quicken Internet connectivity.

In the final year of the project, from November 2015 to June 2016, they
launched and broadcasted the *Toktok Fairtrade* radio program with PNG's
National Broadcasting Corporation -- 10-12-minute segments on issues
related to Fairtrade farming and distribution. They developed a
partnership with UNITECH to develop textbook and video computer training
modules in Tok Pisin and English, and successfully rolled-out
village-based ICT trainings for target groups. They extended
interventions to an additional two target groups, and rolled out the
final ICT interventions. They held a closing workshop and conducted a
participatory evaluation of the IFAD-funded project with target groups
and partner organizations, identifying key benefits and future ICT
opportunities. Lastly, they developed educational and promotional
videos, demonstrating the reach and impact of the IFAD-funded project.

Fairtrade producers now have stronger connections within their
organizations, with their network of fair trade producers in PNG and the
Pacific, with their supply chain partners, and with support
organizations, including Fairtrade ANZ. Beyond the direct outcomes of
this project, the pilot contributed to the wider sustainability of rural
communities in PNG. Access to communication leads to increased security
for women and children, ICT trainings target broader learning gaps for
farmers and their communities, and investment in solar technology
encourages producer organizations to plan for greater investment in
clean energy consumption.

Through this project, Fairtrade producers were actors in their own
development, identifying opportunities for growth and strengthening, and
taking the lead in trailing new technology among their communities. They
are now positioned to plan and develop new and more profitable
enterprises leveraged through ICT solutions, building on better
information about markets and collaboration with other actors in the
supply chain.

At the end of the project, 80 percent of partner cooperatives chose to
continue the use of the voice and data services offered by Digicel
through their own resources, demonstrating the successful uptake of ICT
interventions. Access to ICTs has improved cooperatives' connections to
their market, enabling new relationships between cooperatives and their
buyers -- both their exporters in country, and their importers and
roasters or manufacturers overseas. A more direct relationship with the
market, through improved ICT capacity of cooperatives, results in
efficient relay of information in regards to shipments, quality,
weather, and timings, preparing farmers for economic, social, and
environmental shocks and potential disasters.

Challenges
==========

**Finding service providers --** Freelance information technology (IT)
training organizers contracted to conduct farmer training on basic
computer literacy dropped out midway through the project, causing
implementation delays. There were also delays due to the difficulty of
securing reliable service providers.

**Remoteness of farmers --** Reaching farmers to train them and provide
supplies is difficult due to the remote location and limited
infrastructure. Before the project had been implemented, the
communications networks to communicate with farmers were not in place;
thus, communicating with them was difficult.

**Lack of infrastructure --** Electricity is often not available in the
rural farming communities. A basic power supply is a prerequisite to
having ICT access. In this case, some farmers had mobile phones but no
way to charge them.

Fairtrade ANZ's Suggestions for Future Projects
===============================================

**Consult farmers --** The original project concept and funding was to
provide mobile phones to farmers. Yet, consultations revealed that a
majority of farmers already have mobile phones, and what they really
need is stable electricity supply to charge their phones and devices.
Running out of phone credits, a lack of an email address, and limited or
no internet accessibility were also pressing problems too. Consultations
allowed the funding to be allocated more productively, and it also
facilitated the development of a local oversight board that could
oversee project implementation and facilitation.

**Working with local university is beneficial --** Locating reliable
freelance IT trainers proved impossible. Partnering with the local
technical university, UNITECH, was a positive solution to generate
consistent training protocols and local relationships to sustain the
project and maintain consistency in implementation.

**Solar power can be a useful tool --** In circumstances where
infrastructural development is slow, prohibitively expensive, or
otherwise not possible, new technologies like solar panels can help
close the digital divide by simply supplying rural communities with
reliable electricity.

**Sustainability considerations are essential --** The project goal was
to put the tools in place to generate a self-sustaining industry and
community infrastructure. The project was meant to be superseded once
its implementation became self-sustaining, so the limited funding was
taken as a premise and used as a motivation for the design and scope of
the project.
