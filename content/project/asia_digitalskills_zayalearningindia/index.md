Executive Summary 
==================

Zaya Learning Lab is a non-profit organization providing Wi-Fi access to
low-income, English-language schools in India. Established in 2013,
their unique learning-focused connectivity devices provide Internet
access and educational content at a much lower cost than a regular, open
Internet-enabled Wi-Fi connection. Zaya seeks to tailor connectivity
solutions to the needs of a specific region, culture, and institution,
and leverages technical and person-to-person communication to make
Internet access an effective tool for education.

Context
=======

Zaya Learning Lab is based in Mumbai, India -- a city of nearly 19
million people according to the 2011 census. The amount of wired and
wireless subscriptions in western India total nearly 35.5 million. A
majority of these are mobile broadband (31.9 million). This region also
sees stark inequalities in the provisioning of Internet infrastructure.
There is no connectivity at all in many rural regions in the surrounding
region.

As of 2017, there are more than 900 million Indians without access to
the Internet, and Zaya Learning Lab serves schools primarily in these
areas. Besides Zaya Learning Lab, other inroads have been made to speed
up the deployment of network technologies in unconnected regions. For
instance, Google launched an initiative to provide free Wi-Fi hotspots
in every railway station in India, while the Indian government unveiled
a plan in 2017 to supply free Wi-Fi to more than 1,050 rural villages
across the country.

Project Description
===================

Zaya Learning Lab provides affordable Wi-Fi to low-income Indian schools
via a curated secured dynamic device called ClassCloud. This device is
both a wireless router and a high-process server. It functions like any
cloud service on the Internet, provides a wide-ranging Wi-Fi signal, and
runs software all at once. For a yearly fee -- roughly the cost of \$1
per year per child, in their estimation -- Zaya provides interactive and
region-appropriate digital content through this device.

This content is based on an educational methodology known as "blended
learning," which harnesses the capabilities of an online classroom in
order target students' individual requirements, education levels, and
learning speeds. Not only is the software able to dynamically respond to
each student's progress through a digitized workbook or textbook, but
this software is also programmed to communicate student struggles and
successes to Zaya and their content providers in order to refine and
improve their tools.

Zaya currently has 400 schools spread throughout India subscribing
yearly to their service, which reaches about 200,000 children between
the ages of 5 and 15. They are currently working on expanding the age
range of their software content to 15 and continuing to subscribe
additional schools -- in and outside of India -- to their service.

Progress and Results
====================

Zaya effectively implemented solutions using diagnostic data analysis to
refine the content of its educational software and overcome most of the
challenges it faced. They describe their early phase as one focused on
data collection and analysis with the goal of creating the most
sustainable model possible as they move forward with their development.
With confidence in their refined content, implementation methods, and
secure networks/devices, they are focused on scaling up to larger and
larger numbers of schools that would benefit from their program. Zaya
currently has 400 schools subscribed to its program.

In an experiment in which half a class was given the online blended
learning tools and the half kept their usual classroom practices,
outcomes showed a twofold rate of acceleration in the online group. In
addition, Zaya demonstrated that online learning meets previously
unaddressed affective and socio-cultural needs in the classroom.
Students were shown to be more willing to make mistakes and learn from
them in front of a tablet than they were in front of a teacher.
Socio-culturally, online learning consciously addresses the specific
needs of low-income students who lack the additional support that middle
income or wealthy students receive at home.

Challenges
==========

**Sustaining administrative interest --** Enthusiasm for and interest in
online learning by the school's administration is key to the successful
implementation of Zaya's system. The organization has devised feedback
tools (such as fiscal "report cards" showing how much their device has
saved a school as compared to a traditional Wi-Fi system), and put
effort into communicating the scholastic value of their product. They do
this because they have learned that the system cannot relay its benefits
effectively without support from a school's principal. This support,
however, cannot always be relied upon. Since the successful
implementation of this product involves an effective shift in
institutional practices, there is a certain top-down affirmation model
needed.

**Lack of widespread connectivity --** Zaya notes that there is an
outsider's myth of easily accessible Internet in India. In fact,
infrastructural development for Internet connectivity is not as
widespread as assumed. Additionally, in many places in India, a culture
of normalizing Internet use has yet to take root. Zaya reports that it
is not uncommon for those who have data access on their mobile devices
to be uninterested in or afraid of turning it on as well.

**Engaging international aid organizations --** Zaya has effectively
partnered with private organizations, such as corporations and
nonprofits, but has not yet found a way to involve large-scale aid
organizations such as UNESCO or Save the Children in the funding and
dissemination of their hardware and content. They are interested in
partnering with such groups and are looking for ways to garner their
interest and support.

Zaya's Suggestions for Future Projects
======================================

**Curated content helps learning --** Zaya reports that early attempts
to implement open-source Internet access and educational content were
unsuccessful as unlimited Internet access was distracting for both
students and teachers. In addition, open-source learning software was
not effectively translated to the rural lower-income Indian context that
the connectivity program targeted. The program's success lies in its
focus on providing schools limited but concentrated access to the
Internet. The curated online content, solely intended for educational
purposes, made a large impact on classroom learning.

**Classroom impact --** This case demonstrates the positive impact of
technology in the classroom. When implemented effectively, online
learning has the potential to enhance the level of individual support
teachers are able to provide students across the personal developmental
and socio-economic spectrums.

**Training and support --** In Zaya's experience, extensive training and
support is necessary in order for its online tools to be efficiently and
effectively used in the classroom. Simply providing tools and access
(e.g., handing out tablets, installing Wi-Fi, digitizing content, etc.)
will not necessary foster better learning outcomes. This support is not
limited to how to use the devices and Internet content; it also includes
training to face new challenges of classroom management and lesson
planning that accompany the introduction of connectivity. This indicates
that the more that connectivity is institution-specific and
results-oriented, the more training, communication, and technical
support will likely be needed for its users.
