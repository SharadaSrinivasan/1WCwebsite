Executive Summary 
==================

The Senegalese Chapter of the Internet Society (ISOC) has provided
connectivity and information and communications technology (ICT)
equipment to the primary school in Thieyetou, a forest-encircled village
of 1,800 inhabitants in the Diourbel region of Senegal. An ISOC
Community Grant in 2017 facilitated the purchase of desktop computers,
tablets, a printer, and long-range router, as well subsidized the
significant travel costs necessary to reach the remote area. The
project's goals for its implementation of connectivity include increased
school retention rates, improved socio-cultural cohesion, and enhanced
academic materials and methods for its pupils.

Context
=======

Senegal is a country located in West Africa with deep French colonial
roots and a population that is more than 90 percent Muslim. Education in
Senegal is split into two very different, and often competing, systems:
secular education in the form of Senegalese state schools, and Islamic
education in the form of Qur'anic schools (daaras). Senegalese state
schools are modeled after the French education system and offer a
standard curriculum of subjects like mathematics and grammar, while
Qur'anic schools prioritize learning and memorizing the Quran along with
values of obedience, respect, and piety.

For religious, ethnic, and cultural reasons, parents often send children
to daaras for informal Qur'anic education to instill Muslim values
before transferring them to the formal state schools. According to the
Paris School of Economics, however, about a third of all boys and about
a sixth of the girls continue through long-term Qur'anic schooling.
These religious schools are tuition-free, resource-deprived, and do not
have any set curriculum or timetables, often resulting in poor quality
education. The high demand for Qur'anic schools is partially attributed
to a struggling public education system. With widespread poverty and low
prioritization of education, enrollment in the state schools is
relatively low. In recent years, there has been an increase in school
ICT initiatives throughout the country, but there are numerous barriers
in place including maintenance of computer networks and connectivity due
to untrained locals and poor electrical infrastructure.

Project Description
===================

The village of Thieyetou, while small and remote, is a cultural
touchstone in Senegal, as it is the birthplace and burial site of Cheikh
Anta Diop (1923-1986), a scientist and philosopher. Providing Internet
connectivity to the primary school in Thieyetou, which also serves the
children of the surrounding villages of Garame, Ndari, Koure, and
Ndialigue, aims to empower and support students in pursuing their
education by narrowing the resource gap between this school and better
equipped urban institutions in Senegal.

An ISOC grant has made Internet connectivity available for the very
first time in the village. In addition to enhancing the school's
academic resources, the school functions as an Internet café for the
community at-large. By charging a nominal fee for Internet usage and
garnering the support of the community as a whole to protect, value, and
maintain these newly available ICT resources, the project has made
strong progress in developing a sustainable model of connectivity for
the area.

Progress and Results
====================

The primary school in Thieyetou currently has four teachers, eight class
levels, and 230 pupils. While the Ministry of Education provides
standardized print materials, the school has a dearth of supplementary
materials for learning and lacks so much as a library. Internet
connectivity is helping students access a greater variety of learning
materials and helping them to develop research skills. Further, schools
in Senegal are split into two types: national/secular and
traditional/religious. While the schools under the aegis of the Ministry
of Education follow a French-influenced curriculum and aim to prepare
students for university study and professional development, the daara
(Islamic school) provides instruction in Arabic and mastery of the
Qur'an. By providing an open center for Internet connectivity, the
project hopes to bridge the gap between students from religious and
secular schools, as well as provide resources for religious students to
access information and learning materials that would enable them to
pursue further education, professional training, and communication
outlets and skills that the daara alone cannot provide. At the same
time, this common center will allow these two very different kinds of
pupils to interact.

The project also promotes social and cultural cohesion. Secondary school
and university students must travel far from the village in order to
continue their education. Returning to the village during weekends and
holidays poses a difficulty to these higher-level learners, as without
Internet connectivity they lack the ability to keep up with their
assignments. Thus, when older siblings leave the village, they rarely
have the opportunity to return, and often leave their younger brothers
and sisters without learning support. With the advent of Internet
connectivity, older students are better able to return to the village to
improve both family cohesion and provide support for their younger
siblings to progress and stay in school.

The school will receive free Internet connectivity and antennae
installation from Alioune Diop University in Bambey soon, as the 3G
gateway currently provided the project faces capacity constraints. The
new connection will improve the quality and speed of connection, as well
as allow a larger volume of Internet users to connect at once.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of locally relevant and local language content --** Though the
Internet provides a rich variety of information and materials,
open-source school-specific content is not always suitable for
Senegalese pupils. Much of the available material in French includes
Western biases that makes the content unhelpful for the Islamic African
population of Senegal. Well-developed materials from the national
curriculum are available to the school, but only in print format. The
lack of digital materials can pose obstacles to the integration of
connectivity in the classroom.

**High electricity costs --** Uneven electricity supply and high utility
costs have, at times, been prohibitive for the project's long-term
sustainability. The project is soon planning to invest a further US\$
3,000 of its grant money into a solar kit, which will reduce costs and
improve sustainability.

**Lack of skilled manpower** **--** Transportation has been the most
challenging and expensive aspect of this project's deployment, with
researchers and technicians needing to make installation trips across
difficult-to-navigate roads with delicate equipment and bring days of
their own food, water, and other personal supplies.

ISOC-Senegal's Suggestions for Future Projects
==============================================

**Planning and remote monitoring can help reduce transportation costs
--** Because the transportation challenges are so prohibitive, the
project found that planning and preparation as well as remote
participation is useful. While their presence in the village is
sometimes necessary and face-to-face contact is an important element of
their successful creation of an Internet-friendly environment,
technicians and project planners can often accomplish a lot without
overspending time and money on travel back and forth to the site.

**Engaging community leaders and the community is helpful to project
take up --** The project planners focused on reaching out to local
community leaders. These figures, religious scholars, and clerics have
the respect of the local community and a great deal of influence.
Relatedly, the project has learned that the involvement of the community
as a whole is beneficial. By communicating well to the entire population
and providing opportunities for them to also use the facilities, the
project increases not only ideological support for their mission, but
also lowers the risk of equipment damage and theft.
