Executive Summary 
==================

Econet Wireless is a nonprofit organization that provides reliable green
power for mobile towers and homes in off-grid rural areas of Zimbabwe.
This electricity also powers vaccine refrigerators in partnership with
the Energize the Chain project to provide vaccines for preventable
diseases to children in these regions. Presently, there are 312 off-grid
mobile towers with vaccine refrigerators and remote health clinics in
operation, with implementation plans in other countries in the region,
such as Ghana, as well as globally.

Context
============

Zimbabwe has about 16 percent of its population able to access some form
of Internet service, remaining among the countries with the lowest rates
of penetration in the world. Furthermore, even among Zimbabweans that
can connect to the Internet, only 54 percent of the population have
access to 3G connectivity -- with most others using 2G service and
millions having no form of access at all.

For a vaccine to remain effective, it must be kept at temperatures
between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. In practice, this means constant
refrigeration from manufacture to administration. The system of storage
and mobile refrigeration units are known as the "cold chain." Last-mile
disruptions cause up to 40 percent of vaccines to be wasted.

Project Description
===================

Econet Wireless has set up off-grid mobile phone towers powered by
robust electrical infrastructure in most rural parts of Zimbabwe. The
electrical supply to these towers is provided by turbines, diesel
generators, and sometimes, solar energy.

In 2013, Econet Wireless partnered with a group known as Energize the
Chain to launch nearly 100 sites across Zimbabwe. In coordination with
the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health, the partnership targeted outreach on a
need basis, prioritizing regions with poor cold chain equipment
performance and poor electrical connectivity.

This "tower power" can provide cellular connectivity to rural
Zimbabweans that are in off-grid locations, and often is the first
electrical power within many communities. In collaboration with Energize
the Chain, Econet Wireless has deployed a model to reduce preventable
childhood deaths among the world's most vulnerable populations by
harnessing the power generated at these stations to solve one of the
pressing challenges of immunization across the developing world -- the
cold chain problem.

The co-location model houses a vaccine refrigerator at a mobile tower
site adjacent to a health clinic in need. By harnessing the cell tower's
excess power, the refrigerator is kept at the required 2 to 8 degrees
Celsius to maintain vaccine efficacy. Vaccine spoilage is minimized,
optimizing healthcare workers' time as well as reaching populations in
the most geographically unfriendly places for vaccine standards
compliance.

Progress and Results
====================

Econet Wireless provides the first Internet access and the first
electricity to many communities in rural areas of Zimbabwe. It offers
home electricity for a US\$ 6 installation fee and US\$ 1 per week for
service. Through its partnership with Energize the Chain, Econet
Wireless has made an impact on the health outcomes of the region's
children. As of 2015, more than 250,000 vaccines have been transported
through or administered at 111 Energize the Chain sites in Zimbabwe. By
2017, this had increased to 312 sites in the country, which lead to the
vaccination of more than 500,000 children.

Moving outside of Zimbabwe, as of 2017, Energize the Chain is
implementing a plan in Ghana as well. Centering on the Upper East, Upper
West, and Volta regions, the project will provide 31 high-need health
clinics. Planning and implementation has also occurred in Lesotho and
Burundi. Outside of Africa, Energize the Chain is working in other parts
of the world as well. In India, for example, the organization has five
sites serving approximately 15,000 children. Finally, Energize the Chain
is working on tangential projects such as infant biometrics and
real-time surveillance of a host of variables related to the
refrigerators, including inventory monitoring and interior and exterior
temperatures reporting.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of affordable access --** Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI)
estimates that 500 megabytes (MB) of mobile broadband costs nearly 30
percent of Zimbabwe's gross national income (GNI) per capita of US\$
840, which is much above the 5 percent threshold set by the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

**Limited and irregular electricity access --** Most of the rural areas
in Zimbabwe do not have reliable sources of power, which presents major
challenges to connectivity since cellular towers require constant power
to remain functional. Immunization programs struggle with several basic
obstacles in vaccine refrigeration and delivery due to unreliable energy
sources and irregular equipment maintenance as well.

**Insufficient data** **--** The remoteness of the vaccine shelters make
it difficult to know the available inventory, especially in cases of
multiple administration vaccines. Energize the Chain and other
organizations are seeking ways to have real-time inventory management to
insure healthcare providers have the necessary vaccines available as
needed.

Econet Wireless' Suggestions for Future Projects
================================================

**Co-location is important --** The exponential growth of mobile
networks in the developing world far outpaces broadband penetration.
Since customers demand uninterrupted service, mobile companies work
tirelessly to maintain power at mobile towers. By making use of the
superfluous power from these towers, refrigerators will always have
electricity. In practice, this guarantees a more efficacious vaccine
distribution model and saves children's lives.

**Not-geographically bound Â­--** Energize the Chain's models are not
specific to the areas where they have run pilots. Impediments to herd
vaccinations and connectivity are generally uniform across the
developing world, with only minor alterations. Additionally, it was not
difficult for Energize the Chain to export their model from South Africa
to the Indian subcontinent.
