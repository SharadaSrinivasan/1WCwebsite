Executive Summary 
==================

Vanu Rwanda deploys Compact Radio Access Network (CRAN) technology to
provide GSM and Wi-Fi connectivity to hyper-rural communities in Rwanda.
Vanu uses a unique wholesale network provider model, where Vanu's
infrastructure can be used by existing Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)
to extend their service. As of 2017, they have built 31 solar-powered
sites in various communities in Rwanda. Three of these sites provide
free Wi-Fi using the sBRCK technology, which works in areas without
connectivity. Each supaBRCK has an advertisement-based service platform
that provides zero-rated content after a short advertisement.

Context
=======

Rwanda is a country with one of Africa's highest rates of broadband
penetration, with 70 percent of the country covered by LTE, and an
overall Internet penetration rate of 36 percent. Pockets of rural
Rwanda, especially in Rwanda's eastern province, however, suffer from a
lack of connectivity. These areas are hyper rural, and present
challenging circumstances for extending connectivity as they: are not
connected to the power grid; do not have existing telecommunications
infrastructure or a network backbone; are largely distant from proper
road infrastructure; and are home to communities with very low
population densities. This often makes them a poor candidate for MNOs to
select for extending their network.

Furthermore, the lack of local skilled labor poses an additional
challenge to routine maintenance of network infrastructure like towers,
making operational costs of running a network very high. Traditional
models of connectivity rollout do not work, especially given that the
average revenue per user is close to \$1, making it economically
unappealing to many incumbents.

Project Description
===================

Vanu's Compact RAN architecture is solar-powered, and operates in
off-grid areas well owing to a very low power consumption of 90 watts.
The vision is to connect the 1 million unconnected people in Rwanda's
rural communities to affordable cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity. It uses
latency and jitter-tolerant, packet-based Internet Protocol (IP)
backhaul with software radios that allow for remote bug fixes. The
architecture can also be maintained easily as a consequence of remote
monitoring, and does not require high technical training. The carrier
grade outdoor base station weighs only 9.6 kilograms and occupies a
6-by-10 meter area. The small form factor allows for simplified mounting
on poles and alternative structures.

Vanu uses a wholesale network operator model, which means that existing
network providers can use Vanu's infrastructure to extend the reach of
their network and penetrate rural markets at lower costs than if they
had to roll out the network themselves.

Vanu has a tie-up with supaBRCK, the product of a Kenyan company, to
provide Wi-Fi. The supaBRCK is a microserver with 500 gigabytes (GB) to
5 terabytes (TB) of memory, and is designed to work in an area without
connectivity with specific physical fortification for outdoor use. A
supaBRCK can connect to RJ-45, Wi-Fi, a subscriber identity module (SIM)
card, directly to backhaul, via Universal Serial Bus (USB), and supports
Secure Digital (SD) cards. At each Vanu site, free Wi-Fi can be extended
using two supaBRCKs -- one at the Vanu tower, connected to the backhaul,
with an extender at the top of the tower to extend range, and another at
the village site. Each supaBRCK has been fitted with MOJA, which is an
advertisement-based service platform that provides content (locally
stored in the supaBRCK's memory).

When a user connects to Wi-Fi, they first see a 15-30 second video
advertisement. Then the MOJA screen comes up, which shows all available
locally stored content on the supaBRCK. At the end of the MOJA screen, a
user can connect to zero-rated Facebook services, zero-rated WhatsApp
service, or the open Internet.

Progress and Results
====================

In 2012, Vanu deployed the first zero-OPEX (operational expenses)
in-building coverage solution in India. In 2013, Vanu launched the first
multi-standard wholesale coverage network through its subsidiary,
CoverageCo, in Vermont, U.S. In 2014, Vanu deployed the first successful
cellular suppression system that prevented the use of illicit mobile
phones in prisons on all cellular frequencies and standards.

In early 2016, Vanu began construction of the first solar-powered,
wholesale network in rural Rwanda that will cover 1 million people who
do not have any connectivity as of early 2018. There are 31 Vanu sites
that are solar-powered currently built in various communities in Rwanda,
and three of these sites provide free Wi-Fi using the supaBRCK
technology.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of telecommunications infrastructure --** Building the cellular
infrastructure in rural regions presents radically different challenges
from building networks in urban areas. The power grid in these areas is
unreliable, if it exists at all. There is no wired telecom
infrastructure to run the network backbone of the cellular network. The
large distance over poor roads makes site maintenance time consuming and
expensive. There is little local skilled labor to support the sites'
maintenance as well.

**Delays in environmental approvals --** Environmental approval from the
government body overlooking Nyungwe Forest provides unexpected delays.
While the expectation was that the approval would be straightforward
since the environmental study was done for the network's fiber optic
construction, the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) has decided it needs to
do a new study.

**Delays in site acquisition process --** Vanu switched the model from
leasing to purchase in order to reduce operational expenses, but the
lead times for purchase are consequently longer, slowing the site
approval process.

**High backhaul cost --** Budgetary quotes provided by the
telecommunications company IHS for backhaul were far lower than actual
quotes. IHS wanted to run their traditional construction/leasing model,
and was not flexible in considering new models. IHS has a de facto
monopoly on towers in Rwanda, so there are few other options.

Vanu's Suggestions for Future Projects
======================================

**Switching backhaul providers may lower cost --** Vanu is considering a
switch over to satellite backhaul for most future sites, which has a
lower OPEX, but higher initial capital expenses (CAPEX). This switch
helps solve some of the site approval issues the project has experienced
as well.

**Educating local telecommunications carriers to new business models and
regulations is necessary --** Local carriers are potentially not as
familiar with the regulations and some of the technical interfaces used
in information and communications technology (ICT) development models.
Regulations allowing these models are often new and have not been used
by the carriers yet, so projects need to allocate more time for
educating the carriers. Rural coverage initiatives have traditionally
been government led, which results in a "tax" on the carriers through
universal service funds (USFs). So, carriers anticipate hidden taxes,
which makes them hesitant to sign up. Having an operating track record
with no government subsidies could help.

**Showing value in rural connectivity is essential --** Rural coverage
is not a priority for carriers; they get a better return on investment
by investing in urban spaces. Thus, Vanu's experience suggests
brainstorming ways to make this appear valuable for them, e.g. enhancing
corporate social responsibility (CSR), could be beneficial.

**Battery choices in off-grid deployments matters --** Lithium-ion
batteries can typically deliver more cycles in their lifetime than
lead-acid. Yet, lithium-ion batteries are rated as hazardous material,
and present logistics challenges when shipping via airfreight**.**
Deep-cycle, lead-acid batteries have been employed in renewable energy
systems and reliably used in off-grid applications globally for decades.
