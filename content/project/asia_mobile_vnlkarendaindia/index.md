Executive Summary 
==================

Karenda is a modest village in Rajasthan, India, that has become a
paradigm for a new digital village cluster. Working with Bharat Sanchar
Nigam Limited (BSNL), the state-run telecommunications company -- which
provides backhaul and subscriber management -- Vihaan Networks Limited
(VNL) provides mobile and Wi-Fi services in Karenda using sustainable
WorldGSM™ technology. Supported by India's Universal Service Fund, it
has also extended these services to two neighboring villages, Bahadari
and Phalsa, to create a cluster of digital villages with a combined
population of 3,590 persons, or 587 households, per the 2011 census. The
signal application in the Karenda Digital Village is the smart class
that VNL has setup in the government school, where e-learning helps
students and teachers follow a new paradigm of education. E-Governance,
too, gets a boost through connectivity at an e-Mitra booth where
citizens can access government-issued identity documents without having
to travel long distances.

Context
=======

As part of the Digital India program, whose vision is to transform India
into "a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy," the
Government of India is implementing plans to bring high-speed broadband
connectivity to about 2,500,000 Gram Panchayats (village councils) in
rural India by 2018. Not all towns have been able to benefit from the
project, however, including Karenda in the northwestern state of
Rajasthan.

Karenda is a small village located in Tijara Tehsil of Alwar District
with a Muslim- and male-dominated population. Agriculture attracts a
small number of workers, and 32 percent of male adults in the village
depend largely on the irregular, temporary work from Bhiwad, the
neighboring industrial town. The village has a government school that
has been upgraded to include a high school as well only recently, and
health facilities are virtually nonexistent.

Karenda is in a vicious cycle of being poverty-stricken and
disconnected. The people here have to travel as far as 30 kilometers to
the nearest town where they can complete government-related or legal
work. As of February 2016, Karenda still did not have access to
electricity, according to VNL. And most of the time, it did not have
stable mobile and data coverage either. Thus, Karenda serves as an
example of an underserved community where the right investment can
transform completely the lives of the people.

Project Description
===================

VNL deployed its WorldGSM™ solution with the objective of providing
integrated mobile, broadband, broadcast, and surveillance services to
the underserved village cluster anchored by Karenda. The VNL site at
Karenda is compact and energy-efficient. A triangular mast with a
mounted WorldGSM™ base transceiver station (BTS) is powered by six solar
panels. The site covers an area extending for 5 kilometers with voice
telephony using GSM. The site also has a surveillance camera and an
Internet Protocol (IP)-based public address system, which can be
accessed via IP or by dialing a phone number connected over GSM for
making important announcements in these villages.

The Wi-Fi access point receives 100 megabits per second (Mbps) bandwidth
from the BSNL exchange in Bhiwadi, a small city in Rajasthan, and is
delivered locally using access points and an omni-directional antenna.
Hops were created to connect the three villages by IP-radios to provide
broadband at the three sites hosting hotspots.

Though access is ubiquitous throughout the village, the government
school in Karenda is one of the biggest users of broadband services. VNL
has installed an e-learning system at the school, which provides a
better, experiential learning platform for students as well as teachers.
The Digital classroom has a large digital whiteboard, and a Linux-based
e-learning platform for providing access to instant information via the
Internet and pre-installed audio-visual content. The Digital Classroom
and the broadband connection are powered by VNL's PowerCube 300, a
solar-based power management solution mounted on the rooftop at the
school.

Progress and Results
====================

Three villages are currently served, with 690 GSM subscribers, 509
broadband users, and 150 students served. The whole project is solar
powered and energy efficient.

Mobile and broadband connectivity in the digital village cluster
anchored by Karenda is helping bridge the digital divide that often
exists in developing economies, enabling development to reach
underdeveloped regions. With cheaper devices proliferating in tandem,
villagers are now connected to family, potential employers, the
government, and the wider world, enabling them to know and learn more,
entertain themselves, socialize, transact and bank, and generally work
and live better. The Digital India program envisages 250,000 digitally
connected Gram Panchayats as well.

By far the most significant contribution has been e-learning, which is
now enabled in the government school in Karenda. Learning has taken a
leap through VNL's Digital Classroom. Children now access vast amounts
of information and material using e-learning platforms and websites,
which significantly impacts attendance. Other than Facebook and YouTube,
students also use Internet to connect to job sites looking for work, or
access information and social media with their connected mobile phones.

Not far from the school, at the periphery of the village, an e-Mitra
outlet was established. This outlet uses computers, printers, scanners,
and photocopying machines to offer documentation services. Internet is
accessed from the VNL broadband network, enabling instantaneous download
and printing of identity documents like Aadhaar cards, grade sheets,
bio-data, etc. Prior to this, the villagers would have to travel
significant distances to access such services.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of infrastructure --** Remote locations are difficult to service
with information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure due
to unstable connectivity and scarce or nonexistent electricity.

**Generational divide --** Because a major point of dissemination of
digital knowledge is the school, older generations do not receive the
same intensity of exposure and education in the new technologies
available. This is a problem with digital education, but also creates
second order social consequences in a changing local culture.

VNL's Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================

**Solar power is useful for areas with poor allied infrastructure --**
In locations with poor infrastructural support, solar power can help
resolve the basic problem of having consistent enough electricity to
sustain a digital initiative.

**Replicability is an essential component of creating long term
sustainability --** Low-cost, low-energy digital villages can serve as
replicable models for other parts of the region, as well as globally.
