Executive Summary 
==================

The Fonias Juruá Project currently comprises of six radio stations in
the Amazonian rain forest of Brazil, close to the Peruvian border. Using
a software capable of generating a signal compatible with the HamDRM
standard, photos are transmitted from one station to the other,
effectively proving the use of the Short Wave band for digital data
transmission using the same radio transceiver used for voice
communication. The project seeks to set up GSM base stations in the near
future.

Context
=======

Amazonian communities are often "beyond the last mile." Some of them are
over a day away by boat to their near nearest public landline telephone,
and lack a continuous source of electricity. Attracted by access to
services, most of these communities have relatives in urban areas but
lacked a means of communication with them.

Project Description
===================

Six HF radio stations have been set up - five of which located within
the Alto Juruá Extravitiate Reserve and one at the headquarters of the
association that represents the reserve, in the municipality of Marechal
Thaumaturgo in Acre. In the pilot phase, using a software capable of
generating a signal compatible with the HamDRM standard, digital
transmission of photos between two stations has occurred. The base
infrastructure for radio communication in the rainforest that existed
during the cold war, is used in an innovative way to enable modern day
communication for these communities.

The project aims to develop a reproducible HF digital radio
communication solution by using HF radio transceivers connected to an
embedded modem. Each node comprises a HF transceiver, an embedded
computer, an interface to connect the two, an antenna, a battery, a
solar panel and cables -- and costs approximately US\$ 6000 in total.

As signals in the HF band provide a very large coverage area, digital
transmission can enable the use of the same to provide connectivity to
hitherto unconnected communities. During the testing phase, signals from
Brazil, Bolivia and Peru were intercepted, and communication was also
established with a station in Peru.

Progress and Results
====================

Communities in the six locations within the Amazonian rainforest have
now been able to establish voice communications using radio waves, and
are able to use the connectivity to draw attention to health emergencies
and seek help from local authorities. Further, the communication link
enables them to communicate with their family members, and relay safety
messages.

The project team is presently designing experiments to test the
viability of the link in providing services to the school and the local
health center, in two of these locations. The goal is to enable file
transfer using the HF band, in order to provide education and healthcare
related information tailored to the needs of the community.

Challenges
==========

**High infrastructural cost:** Fiber optic networks, local Internet
service providers, or terrestrial line-of-sight radio are not viable
options due to the high cost of infrastructure and equipment to deploy
the network in these communities, which are among the poorest in the
world.

**Lack of easily available backhaul:** Reservations in the middle of the
Amazonian rainforests lack access to a lot of transportation
infrastructure, and have no viable access to backhaul.

**Manpower for deployment:** Local communities were galvanized to
provide the manpower to lay the infrastructure in collaboration with the
project team, owing to the short supply of high skilled technical labour
in the region.

Fonis Jurua's Suggestions for Future Projects
=============================================

**Innovative solutions using existing infrastructure must be
experimented with, for difficult terrains** --Radio wave bands can
provide an innovative solution to connecting communities that are in
hyper-remote areas that face significant infrastructural barriers. In
this case, some of the cold-war era infrastructure was leveraged in
order to provide connectivity to communities that had no access to means
of communication.

**Partnerships with local communities is key** -- Collaboration with
local communities helps with successful implementation of projects and
maintenance over a longer period of time
