Executive Summary 
==================

Datamation is a nonprofit organization established in 2002. Based in
India, Datamation is an educational foundation that links its students
with skills enhancement and technology. Datamation focuses on providing
its services to women, especially those who depend on informal labor
markets. By training students in both basic and digital literacy and
offering robust online vocational training in a variety of different
fields, Datamation facilitates income opportunities for women in
marginalized social communities in India.

Context
=======

Out of more than 460 million Internet users in India, only 21 percent
are women according to the Asia Pacific Insight Report. Men are 62
percent more likely to use Internet, and 25 percent more likely to own a
subscriber identification module (SIM) card. The gender gap in Internet
access and usage varies from urban to rural areas -- while 40 percent of
daily Internet users in urban areas are women, only 25 percent in rural
areas are. Women face multiple barriers in accessing information and
communications technologies (ICTs) -- not only the economic, but also
the cultural and social constraints, according to the *Asia Pacific
Insight Report: Women and Technology in India*. The biggest obstacles
are the high cost, unreliable connection, and lack of free time. For
non-users, however, the report found that lack of interest is the
biggest barrier. In addition, a social stigma of women using mobile
phones outside their houses discourages many women from accessing the
Internet.

Many government- and private sector-led initiatives are underway to
promote digital literacy among women in India. As part of the national
Digital India Initiative, the Gujarat state government signed a deal
with Google India to provide digital literacy training for women and
children in Gujarat. Google has also partnered with Digital Empowerment
Foundation (DEF) to implement the Digital Literacy, Safety, and Security
program that prioritizes serving the vulnerable groups (women, children,
etc.) to not only be digitally literate, but also safe on Internet.

Project Description
===================

Datamation was established in accordance with the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) global
mandate to provide connectivity and technology to those whose social,
economic, and/or geographic positions make access to digital culture
difficult. Datamation's educational programs are geared toward
generating income opportunities for those who are socially marginalized.
They put a particular emphasis on educating, advocating for, and
protecting women. Datamation's socially engaged technological vision
manifests not only in its work in literacy and employment, but also in
its "women-centric" curriculum that aims above all at empowerment. The
multimedia centers and education kiosks that make up the Foundation's
brick-and-mortar operations provide opportunities for vocational
training and basic education, but also socially motivating assistance,
such as help navigating Islamic divorce or domestic violence. By
partnering with international and local development agencies as well as
private donors, Datamation has built a sustainable model to invest in
the education of poor and disenfranchised communities.

Progress and Results
====================

Datamation has worked to develop its local content in collaboration with
the community it serves. Much of the vocational training it provides has
been created with input from local community members and
intergenerational knowledge.

Around 40-45 percent of participants are linked to a market as a result
of their training at Datamation's resource centers, either by obtaining
regular employment or starting their own businesses.

Datamation's largest centers in Delhi and Lucknow are not only
sustainable, but also generate surpluses. The rural centers still
require investment from DEF, but Datamation is actively aware of the
need for sustainable business models and aims not to rely on donors.

Challenges
==========

**Limited and irregular electricity access --** Power supply to
Datamation's educational centers is unreliable, particularly those in
rural areas.

**Lack of Internet access --** Internet quality too can be irregular.
This problem increases with decrease in population density, as ISPs lack
profit incentive to improve their connection in areas with few
customers.

**Social norms --** Datamation engages religious leaders directly in
order to advocate for technology and connectivity as a public good. It
is important for Datamation Foundation to communicate that they are not
endorsing particular political or religious agendas that may have strong
online presences nor are they exposing people to inappropriate
materials.

Datamation's Suggestions for Future Projects
============================================

**Local content tailored to specific contexts aids training --** In this
case, local content has been defined according to both regional and
class-based criteria. Not only has the curriculum been aggregated from
collections of local knowledge, but the centers are also careful to
provide a level of content appropriate to the communities it serves. In
its rural centers, Datamation provides more simplified and streamlined
content to match the literacy levels of the population it serves. In
these centers, the instructors play a larger role in the computer-based
teaching models that the urban and metro centers share.

**Sustainability is linked to fostering a notion of collective
development as a community --** Datamation notes the importance of
establishing both opportunities for education as well as cultural
engineering that promotes the notion of self-development in relation to
a collective. This collective development is key not only for the
success of its students in their studies and workplaces, but also for
the sustainable future of the program itself.
