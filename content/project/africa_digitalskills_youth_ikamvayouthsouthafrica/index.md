Executive Summary 
==================

Ikamva Youth, a nonprofit founded in 2004, equips learners from
disadvantaged communities in South Africa with the knowledge, skills,
networks, and resources to access tertiary education and/or employment
opportunities once they matriculate. Ikamva Youth aims to increase the
collective skill level of the population, grow the national knowledge
base, and replicate its success in more communities. Ikamva Youth
currently operates with branches in five provinces of South Africa:
Western Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Northwest, and Eastern Cape. While
learners enroll at Ikamva Youth when they are in grades 9, 10, and 11,
the program's success is ultimately determined by the number of grade 12
learners who access tertiary institutions and/or employment-based
learning opportunities when they matriculate. The Ikamva Youth model
draws from a large and growing pool of volunteers made up of students
from nearby universities and local professionals. Notably, ex-learners
who gain entrance to tertiary institutions and return to tutor drive the
organization's sustainability.

Context
=======

Statistics about literacy rates in South Africa are rather inconsistent.
While the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) estimated that 98.96 percent of people between the
ages of 15 to 24 were literate in 2015, the 2016 Research on
Socioeconomic Policy brief showed that 58 percent of Grade 4 learners in
South Africa could not read for meaning, while 29 percent are completely
illiterate. Nevertheless, the quality of education in South Africa has
been lamented by many researchers, policy-makers, and concerned
citizens.

The high cost of labor, low skills, difficulty job searching, and
persistently low employment outcomes are some of the barriers for South
African youth to securing employment. The challenging job search is
related to the fact that poor youth cannot afford or are incapable of
using the Internet to search for jobs or postsecondary education
opportunities, and it is difficult for them to leverage their social
network.

The South African government and other organizations have been striving
to address youth unemployment issues through various programs. The
National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) is an agency established in
2008 that is operating the National Youth Service (NYS) program, which
tackles youth unemployment. The Fit for Life, Fit for Work program
provides young people with a comprehensive program that offers life
skills and work-related skills training, and job search assistance, with
a 80 percent success rate. Additionally, the Harambee Youth Employment
Accelerator project takes a different approach by advocating employers
practice inclusive recruitment that focuses on young people.

# Project Description

Ikamva Youth aims to increase the collective skill level of the
population, grow the national knowledge base, and replicate success in
more communities. Ikamva Youth works with learners from township-based
secondary schools to help them improve their grades, access quality
post-school opportunities, and return to help others do the same. Ikamva
Youth accepts learners based on their motivation to participate, as
opposed to their academic results; most learners have averages well
below 50 percent when they join, for instance.

Ikamva Youth currently operates with branches in five South African
provinces: Western Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Northwest, and Eastern
Cape. They operate 17 centers in total, with 14 computer labs featuring
25 computers each. While learners enroll at Ikamva Youth when they are
in grades 9, 10, and 11, the program's success is ultimately determined
by the number of grade 12 learners who access tertiary institutions
and/or employment-based learning opportunities when they matriculate.

Ikamva Youth's services are free for the participants. Those programs
include Internet access and Internet and computer literacy training.
They offer open Internet access, with the exception that some websites
are blocked for educational purposes (e.g., pornographic websites). They
partner with Computers for Kids to generate the training curriculum. The
training programs focus on supplementary tutoring and homework sessions,
career guidance, mentoring, computer literacy and access, the Media,
Image, and Expression program -- which enables learners to express
themselves creatively and assertively as well as build their self-esteem
-- and the Health and Leadership program that ensures HIV/AIDS,
nutrition, and broader health awareness and voluntary testing provides
learners with the information and voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)
services they need to manage their health. Training lasts for three
hours per week over the course of six months, and is conducted after
school, on weekends, and during school holidays.

The Ikamva Youth model draws from a large and growing pool of volunteers
made up of students from nearby universities and local professionals.
Additionally, ex-learners who gain entrance to tertiary institutions and
return to tutor drive the organization's sustainability. More than half
of the volunteers at longer-established branches are ex-learners, and
more than 80 percent of the Khayelitsha management committee comprises
of ex-beneficiaries. Thus, Ikamva Youth provides the additional
advantage of allowing ex-Ikamva Youth learners to be agents of change,
from beneficiary to benefactor.

Progress and Results
====================

Since 2004, thousands of committed learners have participated in Ikamva
Youth programs, with an attendance rate of 75 percent and higher. There
are currently 14 Branches in five provinces across South America, and
approximately 1,900 learners currently registered at the branches from
grades 8-12. Ikamva Youth currently supports other nonprofit
organizations to deliver an after-school tutoring program, which
supports approximately 800 learners. Ikamva Youth has consistently
achieved between an 80-100 percent high school matriculation pass rate
since 2005. Since 2010, 43 percent of learners have achieved bachelor
passes (previously, matric exemptions), and 31 percent achieved a
diploma. Overall, 65 percent of those learners who have matriculated
from high school have accessed tertiary education, an internship, or
employment within two-and-a-half months of matriculating. Many
matriculating learners from previous classes are staying on to volunteer
for the next generation of learners.

The University of Cape Town's Development Policy Research Unit conducted
an independent evaluation of Ikamva Youth's work, and found that more
than 97 percent of graduates reported that the program inspired them to
work harder, Moreover, while 83 percent said it changed their
expectations of what they can become, 85 percent said it helped them
access post-schooling opportunities.

Ikamva Youth's impact reaches beyond individual successful learners as a
result of its democratic approach to leadership and developing civic
awareness in the communities they work in. At its core, Ikamva Youth
addresses the challenges of urban poverty and inequality perpetuated by
South Africa's education crisis.

The project has received many awards, including a 2014 Global Social
Benefit Institute (GSBI) Accelerator program scholarship from the Miller
Center for Social Entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University in
California, a 2013 Ashoka Fellowship, a 2013 Stars Foundation Impact
Award, and a 2010 Drivers of Change award from the Southern African
Trust.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding** -- The program is expensive to run,
especially the costs of data, Internet service, and installation of
devices and infrastructure to support connectivity.

**Equipment damage** -- Break-ins, theft of equipment, and vandalism of
labs is common. Serving low-income populations with uneven commitment to
the project in areas with relatively higher amounts of crime means the
labs can be vulnerable.

**Limited and irregular electricity access --** Power outages in the
serviced areas make connectivity unreliable.

**Technological obsolescence --** Technology is always changing, and
laptops are superseding desktops and tablets. Keeping up with the pace
of updates is expensive and time consuming, and means users need to be
trained constantly on new equipment.

Ikamva Youth's Suggestions for Future Projects
==============================================

**Community participation is key --** To combat vandalism and theft, and
raise rates of new user adoption, it is important to make the community
a part of the project, with a stake in its maintenance and
sustainability.
