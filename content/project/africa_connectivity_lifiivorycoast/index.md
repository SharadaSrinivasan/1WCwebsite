Executive Summary 
==================

Li-Fi LED is a government-affiliated technology startup in the Ivory
Coast that specializes in the intersection between Li-Fi (Light
Fidelity) Internet technology and sustainable energy. Li-Fi technology
provides high-speed Internet connectivity using everyday light bulbs and
specialized receivers. Unlike Wi-Fi, which uses radio frequencies, Li-Fi
relies on the visible light spectrum. Li-Fi LED has accomplished its
short-term goals of providing connectivity and sustainable solar energy
infrastructure to several difficult-to-reach border villages in the
country, and seeks to achieve broader region-wide rollout in the long
term.

Context
============

The National Development Plan of the Government of Ivory Coast aims to
increase the information and communications technology (ICT) industry's
input into the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by 15 percent.
There is wide disparity in electricity accessibility, with rural access
as low as 36.5 percent in comparison to the urban access average of 88
percent. Programs such as the Orange Rural Electrification Program in
2016, the Rural Electrification Program running until 2030, and the
government's Electricity for All initiative, are actively increasing
access to rural areas. In terms of affordability, households are given
the opportunity to pay just US\$ 2 upfront for electricity and pay the
remainder of the large upfront cost over 10 years.

The country is covered by a 2G mobile network, with most urban centers
having at least 3G, and almost all citizens having access to a mobile
phone and mobile network at a relatively low cost. In Ivory Coast, 22.6
percent of households have Internet access and 26.5 percent of
individuals regularly use it. Internet affordability in Ivory Coast is
ranked within the top 10 in Africa due to easy access to undersea fiber
optic cables. The allotment of 7,000 kilometers of land in early 2017 to
continue developing and sustaining the domestic ICT network enables
rollout. In addition, the private sector has instituted several
initiatives to promote connectivity. Orange, one of the largest mobile
providers in the Ivory Coast, has established cyber centers in major
cities.

Project Description
===================

Li-Fi LED selected the village of Drongouiné to deploy its initial major
project due its geography and lack of infrastructure. Drongouiné sits on
the Ivory Coast's side of the border with Liberia and has suffered from
violence and resource deprivation due to conflicts in the region,
notably the Liberian civil war. Before Li-Fi LED's intervention, the
village was completely lacking in energy infrastructure, which made the
region's capacities for vital provisions such as communication and
healthcare difficult. Li-Fi LED distributed Li-Fi kits to more than
5,000 residents of the village. Each kit contained electrical wiring, a
Li-FI receiver, a solar panel, and LEDs. By providing the tools for
wireless connectivity and sustainable energy, Li-FI LED aims to
revitalize the village by providing opportunities for communication,
education, and economic development. Their business model includes a
"freemium" subscription, which is free but comes with advertisements, as
well as premium subscription, which is paid but ad-free.

Progress and Results
====================

As of Summer 2017, 5,000 residents of rural border villages in the Ivory
Coast have been equipped with Li-Fi kits. The deployment of this
technology has allowed residents regular access to the Internet for the
first time. The introduction of solar power technology and equipment has
also newly granted them regular energy supply. Villagers previously
relied on lamps and candles for light during the evenings, and had to
walk significant distances to recharge their phone batteries. Li-Fi LED
has facilitated distance training in various agricultural methods for
local farmers. Part of the goal of providing Internet access to these
villages was to provide incentives to young villagers who were pursuing
opportunities in more developed regions.

Challenges
==========

**Technical challenges --** Unlike Wi-Fi, Li-Fi signals cannot pass through
walls. In order to receive full connectivity, one would have to place
appropriate bulbs in every room of a building or and also on the
exteriors of structures. Furthermore, the lights need to be on at all
times in order to assure continuous connection, though they can be
dimmed.

**High cost of deployment--** The delivery costs the project faced bringing equipment
to rural border villages were relatively high and the delivery times
were longer than anticipated.

Li-Fi LED's Suggestions for Future Projects
===========================================

**Recycling hardware can be effective and bring down costs --** Li-Fi
LED uses locally recycled materials in order to reduce the costs of
their equipment and installation.
