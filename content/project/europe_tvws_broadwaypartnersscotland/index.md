Executive Summary 
==================

Broadway Partners is a United Kingdom-based wireless broadband provider
that has operated since 2016. They use a mix of TV white space (TVWS)
and 5-gigahertz (GHz) technologies to provide comprehensive
connectivity. They target regions impossible to connect with fixed
wireless broadband as well as communities underserved or priced out by
existing broadband options. Broadway Partners hopes to make high-speed
Internet access both widely accessible and affordable, and have deployed
in a mountainous island in Scotland, Arran.

*Keywords: TV white space, island, Scotland*

Context
=======

Located off the southwest coast of Scotland, the Isle of Arran -- or
simply Arran -- is often referred to as "Scotland in miniature." Arran
is divided into highland and lowland regions and shares the Highland
Boundary Fault with Scotland. The south side of the island mostly
consists of lowlands and pastures, while the north is rocky and
mountainous. The population is approximately 4,600, and nearly all of
its inhabitants are elderly individuals, agricultural workers, and those
in the hospitality industry. While year-round residency is low, during
the summer season, the island's population increases to about 25,000
people.

In an attempt to increase connectivity across Scotland, the government
initiated the "Digital Scotland" project. One of the implementations of
this endeavor engages British Telecom (BT), the UK's most popular
broadband provider, to install 800 kilometers (km) of fiber optics and
400 km of cable under the sea. This seeks to bring better connectivity
to more than 700,000 Scottish citizens; however, budgetary and practical
constraints leave about 5 percent of Scotland out of the "Digital
Scotland" initiative -- Arran is one such location.

Project Description
===================

Broadway Partners chose Arran for its initial implementation project for
two reasons. The first reason was the island's extremely limited
connection to the Internet. The second reason was Arran's well-known
appellation: "Scotland in miniature," which acted as a key marketing
tool for Broadway Partners, whose aim has been to radically upscale its
connectivity offerings.

The project began with a very small coverage area in the village of
Machrie on Arran's west coast. As of June 2017, 120 of 400 homes are
newly connected to high-speed broadband Internet. Ten percent of these
homes are serviced by the hybrid network's TVWS technology. Similar to
Arran as a whole, Machrie's permanent residents make up only a small
percentage of its households, a large number of which are seasonal
holiday homes. Thus, this number is quite wide-ranging in its coverage.

Broadway Partners' comprehensive service is largely dependent on its
hybrid network, which incorporates fixed broadband wireless Internet
with TVWS -- a technology made possible by very recent research into
uses for unused TV channels. Fixed broadband relies on clear
line-of-sight for Internet connection to function properly through radio
signals, making certain sites impossible to connect. TVWS, however, has
no line-of-site requirements, and utilizes unused analog television
frequencies to provide high-speed Internet. By partnering with Microsoft
and researchers at the University of Strathclyde and King's College
London, Broadway Partners followed in the footsteps of several recent
TVWS implementation projects in the U.K. and around the globe to
introduce this new technology to Machrie in 2016. The Scottish
government is subsidizing this deployment to the tune of 300 pounds per
resident, in order to make connectivity affordable. Broadway Partners is
currently expanding the network to cover all of Arran.

Progress and Results
====================

Broadway Partners is still in the early stages of its development and
expansion, but they have made significant headway on their pilot in the
village of Machrie in Arran. In addition to Arran, they have initiated
similar projects in Inverness, Scotland, as well as northern Wales. They
are currently looking to expand their program to unconnected and/or
low-income communities around the U.K. and possibly abroad.

The hybrid network in Arran has exponentially increased Internet speeds
from 0.2 Mbps to 10-100 Mbps. Elderly residents of the island are able
to communicate with family members situated elsewhere and allow for
remote health monitoring. One elderly resident's family has CCTV cameras
and a panic button installed inside her home; the button triggers a
video live stream so the family on the mainland can immediately seek
help in cases of emergency.

Residents of Arran use the Internet to connect with family and friends
abroad. One resident reported being able to reconnect with family that
had relocated to Australia, which had been difficult in the absence of
connectivity. Before this deployment, the few residents who were
connected could only use text-based emails and were not able to send or
receive attachments. Now, media sharing is fast and easy, making
attachments such as family photos and videos newly possible to exchange.

One resident used to depend on a weekly, six-hour round-trip commute to
Glasgow for car auctions for work. Now, he can conduct his business
efficiently from his home, saving time, energy, and money. Another
resident, who works as a gamekeeper, has started to use web-based
cameras to more precisely and efficiently track the activity of the
black grouse for which he is responsible.

Challenges
==========

**New technology --** TVWS is a relatively new technology that has not
yet been widely implemented. Broadway Partners found it necessary to
experiment with a range of installation practices, placements, and
distances in order to successfully bridge the gap between theory and
practice.

**High costs of an island trial --** The complications of serving a
small island community were not easily overcome. Certain kinds of
standard installation equipment, such as cherry pickers, were not
available on the island. This forced the installation team to improvise
with their installation and access techniques. The expense, time, and
challenge of receiving parts and materials proved unexpectedly onerous.
Once materials arrived, there was the additional problem of transporting
materials for infrastructural construction to remote areas, often on
very high ground. The company found it difficult but not impossible to
overcome these challenges.

**Lack of sufficient community engagement --** Some members of the
community were unwilling to let their property be used for equipment
placement without significant monetary compensation.

Broadway Partners's Suggestions for Future Projects
===================================================

**Government subsidies help deploy new infrastructure in remote areas
--** A major reason that connectivity is so affordable in this case is
due to the £300 (US\$ 406.71) subsidy offered by the Scottish government
to cover the high cost of installation. This voucher takes the financial
burden of installing new infrastructure off of the consumer and assures
widening access to high-speed Internet. Programs like this one, which
rely on the implementation of new and fairly expensive technology in
underserved areas, would be well served by the government shouldering
the expense of equipment and installation.

**Hybrid networks combining multiple technologies may be necessary for
certain regions --** Broadway Partners is able to offer complete
coverage in the areas they serve because of their hybrid network. They
use a combination of technologies to build a network that is able to
efficiently and affordably harness existing resources and supplement
them with new technologies where necessary.
