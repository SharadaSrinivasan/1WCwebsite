Executive Summary 
==================

EDUS works with the Costa Rica Social Security Fund to implement and
manage a national online health information system serving the 5 million
inhabitants of the country across 29 hospitals and 1,041 sole
practitioner clinics. These clinics typically serve 2,500 to 4,000
patients, and have five employees, all of whom are trained in the use of
the system. The health information system is a centralized repository of
comprehensive patient health records used by doctors and nurses, and an
interface for patients to schedule appointments, access health records,
and manage their healthcare. Despite various cultural and organizational
challenges, this e-government draws attention to the importance of
change management in the success of a nationwide implementation.

Context
=======

Between 2010 and 2015, Costa Rica had the highest jump in information
and communications technology (ICT) use worldwide, according to the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In its National Development
Plan 2015-2018, the government set a goal of 1,000,000 subscribers to
the Internet by 2018, which would make the percentage of Internet users
60 percent of the total population in comparison to 46.7 percent in
2013. Yet, Costa Rica still ranks among the worst countries in terms of
Internet speed, according to a February 2017 OpenSignal Report. The
government is aware of the problem, and is working to improve the
situation.

Digital technologies are one of the seven focus areas in the National
Plan of Science and Technology. To achieve the goals, the government has
partnered with the private sector to embark on the digital
transformation for the country. In 2016, the Ministry of Science,
Technology, and Telecommunications signed a memorandum of understanding
with Cisco to make a joint effort to digitize the government, education
system, healthcare, cybersecurity, and other fields. Unfortunately,
though, little is known about the level of digital literacy among Costa
Ricans.

Project Description
===================

EDUS launched in 2012 with the aim to enact a government law mandating
accessible healthcare to all citizens, and implement a comprehensive
patient health record database for primary (clinical) and secondary
(hospital) care.

The project has been underway for five years, and 90 percent of the
system's implementation has been completed. Implementation involves
preparing the hospital or sole practitioner clinic for Internet
connectivity, setting up the necessary computers and information
technology, entering patients into the database, and training health
care providers and technicians to use the system.

There are three aspects to the transition for health care personnel:
change management, training on computer basics, and training on the
database and affiliated apps. Training is a three-day process in a
classroom with an additional three days of on-site technical support.

The database covers 29 hospitals and 1,041 sole practitioner clinics.
These clinics typically serve 2,500 to 4,000 patients, and have five
employees, all of whom are trained in the use of the system. Internet
speeds are typically 6-10 megabits per second (Mbps).

Progress and Results
====================

As of December 2016, primary care implementation is complete, and all 5
million national citizens are in the records. Furthermore, hospital care
implementation is 61 percent completed. By 31 December 2017, the goal is
63 percent implementation in hospitals. By 31 December 2018, the goal is
99.9 percent implementation in hospitals, and 61 percent overall
implementation.

Centralization allows the government to detect redundancies and abuses
of the system -- for example, patients who try to acquire drugs at
multiple places or who see multiple doctors about the same concern.
Patients are assigned to a specific doctor based on location, and
patients can only see their own doctor unless it is an emergency.

Each doctor is assigned to 2,500-4,000 patients. This maintains the
proper distribution of patients and doctors so the system can work
smoothly. Moreover, anyone can pull up a patient file anywhere.

Challenges
==========

**Resistance by the elderly --** Some of the elderly communities
resisted to the system as they thought the online system is taking away
the opportunity to meet with their friends and community while waiting
in the line for their doctor appointment. For them, hospital was a
gathering point for socialization and exchanging health information with
their peers.

**Resistance by healthcare providers --** Training for nurses on how to
use computers and the online system was crucial. Nurses were accustomed
to taking notes on paper, so the new system altered their work flow
substantially.

**Lack of Internet infrastructure --** Before the system could be
implemented, they first had to provide Internet to all the hospitals
that did not have service. Only 33 percent were initially connected, so
they provided for the rest using fiber-optic connections. They worked
with the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, an Internet service
provider (ISP), and the government to connect the hospitals and clinics.
The problem was not just the lack of existing connections, however, but
also the terrain of Costa Rica (mountainous and coastal), so it took
one-and-a-half years to connect all hospitals. A total of 99 percent of
the regions served had no local area network, so they had to install
one. A special contract with the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad
through the government reduced the cost.

**Lack of electricity infrastructure --** In many cases there was either
limited electrical infrastructure, or the clinical building was so old
that it needed to be retrofitted. A total of 5 percent to 30 percent
needed updating in this regard. For the few clinics lacking electricity,
they used MiFi, which is an Internet chip that can be used with 3G and
4G services to make a "mobile-fi" Internet connection.

EDUS' Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================

**Planning for change management is useful --** EDUS' experience
suggests it is important not to start any project without some change
management system in place, which addresses personnel expectations as
well as skills training for the new programs and applications.
Peer-to-peer skill learning was shown to be most effective, which may
mean training doctors and nurses separately and empowering them to teach
one another within their groups. The system changes every year, with new
personnel and new programs, and they require continuous training. Change
management can be implemented in each hospital and community -- not just
via top-down implementation from the project headquarters, but it may
likely benefit from being an ongoing and dynamic process.

**Considering local sensitivities is necessary --** Local visits and
meetings with patients, healthcare providers, community organizations,
and union groups were key to garnering local support and compliance with
the system. It is important to have local concerns in mind with each
clinic/hospital based off on-the-ground interaction with the affected
personnel and communities. Implementing a new system can incidentally
alter the culture of a community. An automated system removes
opportunities for socializing, and can generate resistance because of
the changes in social organization it entails.
