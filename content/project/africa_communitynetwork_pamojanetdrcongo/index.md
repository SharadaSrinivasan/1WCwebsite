Executive Summary 
==================

Pamoja Net is a mesh-Wi-Fi network on the island of Idjwi in Kivu,
Democratic Republic of Congo. Ensemble Pour La Difference, a
not-for-profit organization has deployed the network in collaboration
with Fjord, an innovation consultancy based in the United Kingdom. The
network has provided Internet access to 10,000 Congolese people through
a public display system and Wi-Fi access points since May 2016.

Context
=======

An estimated 250,000 people live the island of Idjwi in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC). The island has no broadband infrastructure,
and lesser than 10 homes have a computer. The cost of smartphones and 3G
access is too high for most on the island, who survive on less than US\$
1 a day.

The Democratic Republic of Congo is also among countries with incredibly
low broadband penetration, with only 7 percent of users having access to
broadband connections per the GSMA. The DRC was ranked by a *Global
Finance* *Magazine* study as the poorest country in the world. United
States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) statistics estimated that about
63 percent of the DRC population lives below the poverty line, and the
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was US\$ 800 in 2016. For less
than US\$ 2, mobile Internet subscribers can activate small daily data
packages, and monthly data packages start at US\$ 10. The DRC was among
the countries with the lowest Internet speeds as well -- at 0.55
megabits per second (Mbps) as of May 2017 based on data from Worldwide
Broadband Speed League.

Project Description
===================

Given the nature of challenges faced by the residents of Idjwi, Fjord
and Ensemble organized a 'makeshop' with the residents of Idjwi to
identify user patterns for the creation of a public display system. A
large screen was installed in Bugarula, Idjwi's busiest market, to which
Mwami (the king of the island) can send messages using an Android
application. Further, a kiosk with Raspberry Pi computers enables users
to access services online. The kiosk in Bugarula has five tablets and
four computers. The display system is now giving weather and news
information to islanders, with 20-30 users connecting to the Internet
via the access points every day.

The mesh Wi-Fi system has three nodes, one of which connects to the town
of Bukavu on the mainland nearly 60 km away. The system was tested in
the Brahan estate near Inverness in Scotland, which provided an ideal
simulation owing to its remoteness and limited interference from other
signals, before being delivered to king Gervais Rubenga for the
residents of Idjwi in May 2016. Download speeds are around 100 MBp/s

Progress and Results
====================

The online public display system in the local market of Burugawa shares
up-to-date news, health information and messages which are sent by king
Gervais Rubenga from his Android phone. Traders who travel to the
mainland to sell coffee and fish are now able to check the weather
forecast to determine if it is safe to cross the lake, which prevents
many deaths. Further, they have access to information on the prices of
their goods in the local markets. Over 10,000 people on the island now
have access to this system that did not have any access to connectivity
before.

Internet connectivity also provides access to news about security in the
country, which earlier took weeks to reach the residents of the island.
Full access to the Internet is free to the residents of Idjwi right now.
Unlike mobile connections, citizens of Idjwi do not have to disclose
details of their identity to the government while accessing the
Internet, which allows them to escape censorship at the hands of the
regime. To make the project sustainable, the king of the island is
conceptualizing a scheme to keep basic health information and news
available free by charging residents US\$ 2 a month to browse Facebook,
YouTube and other sites.

Challenges
==========

**Challenging terrain:** Idjwi is in the middle of a lake in Kivu. The
nearest access point is over 70 kilometers away in Bukavu on the
mainland. The region is also highly prone to lightning strikes.

**Lack of access to devices:** Most residents in Idjwi did not have a
device that could access the Internet. Less than ten homes had access to
a laptop or computer that could be connected to the Internet, and most
users used legacy phones that were unsuitable for mobile broadband
usage.

**Lack of affordable access:** Several residents of Idjwi earned less
than US\$ 1 a day. 3G and mobile broadband is unaffordable for them

Pamoja Net's Suggestions for Future Projects
============================================

**Public displays for up-to date information sharing can be useful in
areas with low device usage** -- The benefits of Internet connectivity
and up-to-date information sharing can be delivered through innovative
modes such as a public display system, as in the case of Idjwi where
there are fewer than ten computers for an island of about 300,000
residents.

**Needs assessment with local communities through makeshops and constant
feedback mechanisms can lead to innovative solutions** -- Pamoja Net's
team believes in the value of constant feedback from the local
communities that they serve, and created shared solutions to enable
greater utilization of their network. This is useful to improve take-up,
especially in areas where devices adoption may be very low.
