Executive Summary 
==================

Online Vidyalaya is part of a 2014 initiative called "Internet -- Past
and Future -- The Tool for Education Revolution," which sought to bring
digital literacy and e-learning tools to underserved students in the
mountainous region of Nepal. Training was provided to 43 teachers and
360 students from grades 8, 9, and 10 in ten schools in rural Nepal. The
project also provided a web application, onlinevidyalaya.org (meaning
"online school" in Nepalese), which offered students e-books and curated
lessons from YouTube that would be advantageous to the students. Online
Vidyalaya is an example of using technology to increase digital literacy
and access to materials for students in remote, under-resourced regions.

Context
=======

Nepal witnessed 17-fold growth in the number of Internet users: from
only 1.1 percent of the total population in 2006, to 17.2 percent in
2016 -- approximately 4.9 million users as of 2017, according to
Internet Live Stats. Internet users and quality networks are
concentrated in the major cities of Nepal, however, leaving the rural
areas with scarce to nonexistent Internet connectivity.

The Nepal Wireless Networking Project (NWNP) has been a significant
effort to connect the rural areas of Nepal. The project has received
support from various institutions such as the World Bank, the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), George Mason University, as
well as groups of volunteers from the United States, Singapore,
Australia, and more. As of 2013, the project has served more than 140
mountainous villages.

Information and communications technology (ICT) adoption into education
has been recognized by policy-makers, but most initiatives to support
technology use in schools are being taken by private donors and
nonprofit organizations. In 2012, 89 students in rural areas received
the certificates for having completed the two-week training on digital
literacy conducted by the Logged On Foundation and Microsoft Innovation
Centre Nepal. NWNP also partnered with the Nepal Research and Education
Network to develop interactive educational materials for students in
remote areas, while Code for Nepal organized a two-week Digital
Empowerment Training for 20 women to acquire and improve digital skills.

Grade 10 students in Nepal have to take the final examination called the
School Leaving Certificate (SLC) at the end of the year. Despite a low
percentage requirement to pass the exam, a majority of students,
especially those going to public schools in rural areas, still fail
every year.

Project Description
===================

The "Internet -- Past and Future -- The Tool for Education Revolution"
was a 2014 initiative that had two primary objectives. The first was to
introduce students to ICTs. Ten schools were selected, and trainings
were given over two or three days at each location. The trainers were
six information technology (IT) students who had recently graduated.
They first explained the basic use of the Internet. Other lessons
included how to use social media for educational ends, making the
students aware of cybercrime, and lessons on e-governance initiatives.
Lessons were taught via as many methods as possible, including lectures,
PowerPoint presentations, brainstorming sessions, games, and group work,
to students in grades 8, 9 and 10.

The second aspect of the project was the web application
onlinevidyalaya.org. Developed using WordPress and a content management
system based on PHG and MySQL, Online Vidyalaya was a single platform
for the students to access e-learning video and text content. The six
instructors spent four months pouring over the science and math
textbooks used in the relevant schools. After outlining the subject
matter by chapter, they sought out credible sources, primarily from
YouTube, and added them to the Online Vidyalaya portal. This included
approximately 800 videos as well as PDFs of e-books provided by the
Nepalese government.

Primary funding came from an Internet Society (ISOC) grant. Other
partner organizations include Yagiten Pvt. Ltd. for the maintenance of
computer labs, New IT Venture Corporation for e-materials, and the World
Bank.

Progress and Results
====================

A total of 360 students and 43 teachers benefited from this project.
Many had no familiarity with the Internet prior to the training provided
as part of this project. Similarly, most had never utilized e-learning
tools. Since all of the information had been centralized on Online
Vidyalaya, the project circumvented unreliable Internet by uploading the
whole platform onto computers in the school computer lab, and both
students and teachers continue to make use of the portal even though the
project has ended.

Most students did not have an email address prior to the training.
Trainers helped them create them, which they then used to become a
member of ISOC.

Teachers were unaware of technologies such as the Google Drive suite and
blogs, and the training has greatly increased their awareness of the
utility of ICTs in their classrooms.

Challenges
==========

**Time constraints --** One of the largest problems faced by the
initiative was a lack of time. Trainings were originally intended to be
20 hours over 10 days. Yet, because the schools' regular course schedule
could not be disturbed, schools only allowed for a maximum training time
of three-to-six hours a day over three days. After or before school was
also not an option either, as students sometimes travel far distances to
attend school. Trainers also had to travel far distances to reach the
schools, which limited the amount of resources they could bring.

**Lack of infrastructure --** There are a limited number of computers in
the schools -- 20 computers for more than 200 students, and at times,
five computers for 300 students. The lack of hardware considerably
limited the number of students that could both receive training and
access the e-learning materials. Also, Internet connectivity is not
always guaranteed, and the lack of bandwidth was also an issue.

**Lack of funding --** A lack of funding impeded more students from
receiving services.

**Lack of skills --** At the outset of the project, the students are
assumed to have at least baseline familiarity with ICTs; however, this
was not the case. In addition, the training and e-materials are in
English, and many students do not have enough fluency to make full use
of the offerings. Localized Nepalese language materials would be a boon.

Online Vidyalaya's Suggestions for Future Projects
==================================================

**Training duration should be optimized to local contextual realities of
the target population --** The lack of hardware and consequent low
familiarity caused led to copious hurdles. More hardware means more
students can benefit from programs such as these. In addition, the
trainers felt that students would benefit from a longer training. They
estimate at least a week is necessary for the most impactful results.

**Governmental support could go a long way in sustaining online
education initiatives --** While the program chose government schools,
the Nepalese government's only support came in the form of making
e-books available. Further governmental support would likely help in
providing time in the curriculum for this type of training and much
needed funding and resources.
