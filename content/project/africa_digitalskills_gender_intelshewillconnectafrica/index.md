Executive Summary 
==================

Launched in 2014 by the Intel Corporation in partnership with UN Women
and local NGOs, the She Will Connect initiative aims to erode the gender
gap in technological literacy in Africa. Intel offers women in Nigeria,
South Africa, and Kenya digital literacy training, skills for creating
user-generated content, and mentoring for entrepreneurship and
job-readiness. As of 2017, the program has trained over 200,000 women in
face-to-face trainings and reached over 2.5 million women through their
online content. She Will Connect uses local partnerships to efficiently
implement a project for a targeted population and remains flexible in
deployment to meet the target population's real-world needs.

Context 
=======

"Women and the Web", a groundbreaking report from Intel and Dalberg
Global Development Advisers, was released in 2012. Exhaustive in its
reach, the "Women and the Web" report used secondary data, field
research, and surveys to track Internet accessibility and the digital
literacy of young and adult women in 144 low- and middle-income
countries. The report found a considerable gender gap surrounding
Internet access in the developing world. On average, women are 25
percent less likely to have access to the Internet than men. At the
regional level, the disparity grows. The gap increases to 30 percent in
parts of Central Asia in Europe, 35 percent in South Asia, and to nearly
45 percent in sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2013, following the report, Intel launched the SheWillConnect
Initiative to close the gender gap in Internet access in Africa. As a
whole, the continent lags in overall Internet penetration, estimated to
be approximately 29 percent in 2016.

Project description
===================

The guiding aim of She Will Connect is to provide women in emerging
markets access to connectivity and basic technological skills to empower
them socioeconomically.

By partnering with local NGOs in the countries of Nigeria, South Africa,
and Kenya, they provide resources to women along three axes -- digital
literacy, content, and support. Using Intel Learn Easy Stepsâ„¢ modules,
She Will Connect teaches contemporary functionalities of a computer,
such as using email and creating an online resume. Secondly, She Will
Connect has created copious women-relevant content that can be accessed
during these trainings as well as on the organization's website and
Facebook pages. In addition, women are taught how to create their own
user-generated content. Finally, beyond digital literacy, She Will
Connect provides professional mentoring to women to help them find
employment or become entrepreneurs using their new skill sets.
Implementation costs vary by country.

Because of the general dearth of physical technology in many of the
areas that She Will Connect services, the organization found that it
also needed to provide hardware that was easily movable. Two mobile
units are currently in use. The first is a repurpose shipping container
that travels on the back of a truck and remains in a location for
between one week and one month. The second solution, created by a Kenyan
company, was to construct an "ICT unit" that could be transported via
motorbike. This unit includes 40 tablets, a server, and 3G connectivity.

Progress And Results 
====================

She Will Connect have conducted face-to-face digital literacy training
for over 200,000 women in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. To date,
they record over 800 success stories of women who have started a job, a
voluntary professional internship, or a business. In addition, through
Facebook, they are able to reach 2.5 million women in 21 countries with
their content.

Because the trainings are taught in English, She Will Connect pairs one
woman who speaks English and one who does not on the same machine to
ensure the training is comprehensible to everyone. This works to
reaffirm bonds between women in the local regions. She Will Connect
releases their content in three languages, English, French, and Swahili.

She Will Connect has found that the skills taught in the digital
literacy class translate well from PC to mobile, and this can be an
especially important empowerment tool in less developed nations.

In the case of South Africa, the government has recognized the
importance of the digital literacy trainings and they have accredited
the program. This national recognition means that women can more easily
transition from the training to the job market.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of access to devices --**End-users oftentimes have no access to
the technology provided during the digital literacy trainings in their
own communities. In addition, there are also areas where there is simply
no connectivity. Because access to devices and connectivity can be
limited, She Will Connect needed to provide both the physical technology
as well as the literacy training. The organization deployed two separate
mobile units. However, because neither can put technology in the hands
of the serviced population in the long-term, both remain stop-gap
solutions.

**Lack of affordable access--** Even in countries where connectivity is
available, costs are high and out of reach of many citizens.

**Scalability --** Without governmental funding or private donors,
increasing the reach of the programming is severely curtailed.
Similarly, a lack of policy support on a national level also impedes
full population roll-outs.

Intel's Suggestions for Future Projects 
=======================================

**Leverage existing structures and networks to maximize impact --** By
exploiting networks already in existence, such as the connections
between local NGOs and women of the countries serviced, She Will Connect
was able to easily access the population their targeted population. In
practice, these local NGOs were able to orchestrate the trainings with
the resources provided by She Will Connect. Online networks,
particularly social media, can also be exploited. While She Will Connect
primarily focuses on three countries, content on their Facebook page
expands this reach to 21 countries. In addition, platforms such as
Facebook are intended for the presentation of user-generated content
which aligns well with the output of the digital literacy training.

**Attention to cultural specificities is important --** The cultural
conventions governing women's lives differs in each nation. For example,
She Will Connect found that at certain digital literacy trainings, women
were more reserved with men present. The solution, in this instance, was
to create same-gendered trainings. Also, many times women were unable to
dedicate two hours plus transit to attend a training because of work or
familial organizations, so the literacy trainings were brought to them.

**Governmental support can aid proliferation --**While the digital
literacy trainings have been successful, countrywide scalability is
dependent on governmental recognition of the utility of the trainings
and for funding. In the countries serviced, there is a skill gap between
what youth are taught and skills desired by employers; governmental
support of programs such as digital literacy can erode this gap.
