Executive Summary 
==================

Wi-Fi Interactive Network (WIN) is a Filipino technology startup founded
in 2015. They aim to deliver wireless broadband to populations unserved
by major Internet service providers (ISPs). As of June 2017, WIN is in
the early stages of launching a new business model for providing
affordable connectivity to low-income areas of the Philippines. This
model, currently scaled to the island of Luzon, harnesses the
accessibility of small community stores as Wi-Fi hotspots and provides a
digital platform for customers to electronically deposit cash into
online accounts. This case shows the utility of a flexible business
model to address challenges pertaining to widespread affordable wireless
access in remote areas.

Context
=======

An archipelago located southeast of mainland Asia, The Philippines has
the 10^th^-fastest growing economy in the world, according to *Forbes*.
The population of the Philippines is equally split between urban and
rural. Approximately 18 million of Philippines households lack Internet
connectivity, and the majority of these are rural. Even where there is
connectivity, it is plagued by slow speeds averaging 3.2 megabits per
second (Mbps). The Philippines is ranked 107^th^ in terms of connection
speed globally.

Smartphones are affordable in the county, however, data and Internet
plans are not. In fact, the cost of mobile broadband service in the
Philippines is among the most expensive in Asia with an average cost of
\$7.10 per 1 gigabyte (GB). Additionally, according to research firm
IDC, the average cost of Internet in the Philippines is about \$18 per
Mbps, while the global average hovers at \$5. These high costs are
explained by an industry duopoly -- Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT)
and Globe Telecom. To avoid the high monthly costs, approximately 95
percent of mobile users in the Philippines are on a prepaid plan, which
brings the cost down to less than \$3 a month on average.

In recent years, the Philippines government has begun to implement plans
to increase accessibility. Under the umbrella of five-year project known
as the Philippine Digital Strategy, the government has established free
Internet access in almost all public schools, public buildings,
government offices, libraries, universities, train stations, and
airports. A separate five-year plan announced by the government in 2016,
the National Broadband Plan, aims to provide widespread broadband
Internet access.

Project Description
===================

WIN's current business model was born out of the successes and failures
of its previous two business models. Their first version, a sponsorship
model, took advantage of the accessibility and ubiquity of small
community stores as well as bars and restaurants. By building brand
partnerships, WIN aimed to provide connectivity to community members by
bundling Wi-Fi credit into the purchase of certain products. However,
these stores operate on the so-called grey market, and thus function on
very small scales and without point-of-sale systems to verify purchases.
Additionally, the bars and restaurants were difficult to connect because
of lack of available infrastructure.

The second version centered on WIN building its own infrastructure,
rebranding itself as an ISP. As a primarily software-centric company,
however, the challenges of installing and maintaining sustainable
infrastructure led them to abandon the plan and refocus itself on its
strengths.

The third and current business plan incorporates the lessons learned
from these attempts. Returning to a plan involving community stores, WIN
is able to reach communities in convenient, local settings. And by
collaborating with a cable company, WIN is able to outsource its
infrastructural needs and apply itself to accessibility and
affordability.

WIN has used its software expertise to build a digital platform for
storeowners to convert customer cash to an online account. They improve
on the cable company's pre-existing model, which centered on the
purchase of scratch cards for Internet access, by making their digital
wallet a resource not only for Internet connectivity, but also a wide
range of online bill pay and e-commerce platforms. This is a very
significant development in a region and a country where bank accounts
are rare: in the Philippines, 25 percent of people have bank accounts,
and only 7 percent have credit cards. Additionally, by eliminating the
scratch cards, WIN was also able to make connectivity both more
affordable for consumers and more profitable for storeowners.

This new collaborative effort will involve installing service in 600
community stores and serving 30,000 people. The eventual goal is to
scale up the operation across the country, partnering with other local
cable companies. Currently, the project is in its initial stages,
establishing relationships with storeowners, and providing incentives,
training, and resources for them to begin to successfully launch the
project.

Progress and Results
====================

Improving on the scratch card business model means that WIN's
digitization will reduce costs by at least 20 percent. What they
eliminate is not only the card itself, but also the logistical cost of
delivering and collecting the cards and the payments. In addition, they
are able to improve profitability for storeowners by offering a 10
percent commission rather than the 5 percent the scratch card model
offered.

WIN continues to work on its project launch. They hope that providing
affordable connectivity to these areas will impact the ways community
members communicate, purchase, get information, and provide and receive
care.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of access to infrastructure --** The communities that WIN is
targeting are very difficult to provide with wired connectivity. This
means that WIN needed to come up with entirely wireless solutions for
Internet access.

**Lack of familiarity with digital economies --** WIN has purposely made
their interface extremely simple in order to serve a population with
little-to-no digital literacy. In a country with such a small population
of bank account holders, however, they are still facing the challenge of
getting their storeowners to open bank accounts in order to facilitate
their payment and provisions systems. This is the first step toward
meeting the larger challenge of introducing the benefits of online
commerce and bill pay without bank accounts, which they hope to overcome
by providing community members with an easy-to-use platform to access
their own digital wallets through this system.

**Private sector telecommunications duopoly --** Currently, there are
two major telecommunications companies that control 80 percent of the
spectrum in the Philippines. This presents a major roadblock to WIN's
plans to scale up their project. If their project is to succeed, they
will need to work with the government to ensure that they are able to
access the necessary amount of spectrum. There is a newly created
government agency, the Philippines Competition Commission, whose goal is
to enable competition in order to provide competitive pricing. WIN is
hoping that these newly initiated conversations about competition will
spur rethinking of the private sector duopoly on spectrum.

WIN's Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================

**Government support may be helpful --** WIN's experience suggestions
that related projects seeking to decrease the price of connectivity
would likely benefit from the government being an active participant in
the telecommunications sector. Affordable connectivity for low-income
people is nearly impossible without some government intervention
ensuring that these low-interest, low-profit areas for private
corporations are fairly served.

**Infrastructure partnerships between cable companies and software
products may be mutually beneficial --** This case demonstrates the
benefits of collaborative relationships between hardware and software
experts. Here, the strongest business model was the product of WIN's
software expertise drawing on the infrastructural facility and access of
the cable company.

**Leveraging existing community partnerships is key --** WIN is drawing
on pre-existing settings of community gathering and access in order to
provide maximum connectivity to a large swath of people. This case
demonstrates the importance of understanding small-scale community
dynamics, locales, and economies for implementing a successful project.
