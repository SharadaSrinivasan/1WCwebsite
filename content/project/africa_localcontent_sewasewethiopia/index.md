Executive Summary 
==================

Sewasew enables users to curate and contribute content in their native
language. It is named after the Amharic word for *"ladder"* and intends
to provide an online content platform as a ladder to prosperity. The
platform aims to deepen knowledge about various topics relevant to
Africa, to connect users to one another, and to increase awareness about
Africa. The platform hosts crowdsourced content in four languages:
English, Amharic, Afaan oroomo and Tigrigna. As of 2017, the site has
30,000 articles that vary from tips on how to use government services,
travelers' guides for tourists, as well as information on local customs
and culture. Sewasew aims to increase the locally relevant content on
its platform through collaborations with local educational and cultural
institutions, including the Addis Ababa University, the National
Archives and Libraries Agency, and the Oromo Cultural Center.

Context
=======

Around the world, more and more people are coming online, which presents
a new challenge to build meaningful, relevant, and easy-to-understand
content that adds value to people's lives. According to GSMA, a mobile
industry association, around 55 percent of the web is in English, a
language that the users who are now coming online do not speak. This is
a serious challenge for creating a digitally inclusive world. A 2017
study by the Internet Society (ISOC) urged more local content in local
languages, to engage both users and content creators, and result in more
broadband adoption. In the same study, ISOC noted that there was not
enough local content in Africa. There are about 1,500-2,000 languages in
Africa, with 83 local languages and up to 200 dialects in Ethiopia.
According to ISOC, most local languages are not supported major
platforms.

Based on a 2014 study by Addis Ababa University, despite having the
second-largest population in Africa, Ethiopia ranked 45^th^ in terms of
local content by indexed web pages under the country code top-level
domains (ccTLD). Amharic language, the official working language of
Ethiopia, has also been one of the measures for local content. Wikipedia
had approximately 15,308 articles and 1,600 images as of April 17, 2014,
ranking Amharic 107^th^ by the size of articles out of 300 languages
supported on Wikipedia. There is no official tool or reference to
measure the size of blogs or tweets on the Ethiopian context.

Project Description
===================

Sewasew has two meanings in Amharic: grammar or the structure of
language, and a ladder to prosperity to get to the next step in life.
The name seeks to encode the desire to fill the gap around language, and
make it easier for users to share articles in their native language. The
platform aims to empower them with access to useful information. Sewasew
hosts crowdsourced content available in four languages: English,
Amharic, Afaan oroomo, and Tigrigna.

Sewasew is an easy-to-use and fully interoperable multilingual social
network platform, where users can curate and share articles and content
pertinent to Africa. It utilizes a patent-pending multi-language input
tool, a language-agnostic search tool that allows searches in any
language to return results in every language, and a user analytics tool
that automatically to customize users' experience based on their
preferences. Users own their contributions and have an option to
facilitate peer production of content. Users can create and add
explanations on any topic, follow each other to keep track of favorite
users and content producers, directly contact authors to request
explanation of any topic, share articles within or across other
platforms and social media sites, filter topics based on interest areas,
send feedback to other contributors, modify or delete their own content,
register, log-in, and invite other users to the platform.

Sewasew addresses a two-pronged problem. First, there is a lack of
documentation and digitization in Africa. Either information is
documented, or if information is documented, it is often not digitized.
Africa is underserved by platforms like Wikipedia, and undervalued as an
information and communications technology (ICT) market, so tools are not
designed with African users, interests, or language diversity in mind.
Sewasew is designed to rectify this problem by using a crowdsourced
approach and a customizable user-responsive platform. Second, the
platform seeks to resolve the problem of discoverability, in which
language diversity has been the main obstacle. It is also designed to
resolve the problem of input not completely accommodating local
languages. Typically some aspect of the interface has to be navigated in
English before it can be converted to a different language preference,
but the Sewasew system enables top-to-bottom user customization in the
language of choice. According to the Sewasew team, these design features
differentiates them from other similar local content platforms.

The sustainability of the project remains a source of concern. Reaching
out to donors is the first strategy; there is no monetization model in
place yet. Sewasew partners with Addis Ababa University to mobilize
scholars. They are also in the process of partnering with the National
Archives and Libraries Agency, to archive and database content, and the
Oromo Cultural Institute, to promote local language diversity.

Progress and Results
====================

As of 2017, the site hosts more than 30,000 articles. The most popular
articles are related to health with a focus on home remedies, followed
by articles on how to access government services as well as articles on
customs in different villages and countries. The articles are
practically relevant and help expand knowledge. Around 60-70 percent of
the articles are written in Amharic, and the remaining articles are
distributed relatively evenly across other languages.

Sewasew uses Google Analytics to keep track of user access statistics
for the platform. Approximately 10,000 articles are viewed per day, but
only around 1 percent of users are contributing content while 99 percent
are only reading. The site has 3,000 registered users, mostly
Ethiopians, but also sees a fair number of users accessing the platform
globally -- from other parts of Africa and beyond. There are currently
250,000 followers on the Sewasew Facebook page, which features articles
to drive traffic to the site. Around 70-80 percent of users access the
site from mobile devices, and the platform is designed to be mobile
friendly.

Sewasew is working toward developing a monetization model to ensure the
project's sustainability. Some models being considered include
approaching institutions committed to specific causes to sponsor content
to promote an article of their own interest. They are also considering
advertising-based revenue generation models.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding --** The project is currently self-funded
and in search of donors. Models for generating monetized content and
sustainable funding for the project are being considered and developed,
but currently there are no revenue streams in operation.

**Regulatory challenges:** **Internet shutdowns --** Internet access
across multiple African countries is intermittent due to shutdowns as
well as inadequate infrastructure. The platform is on the web, so it is
only useful to the extent that Internet access to it is reliable.
Improving Internet access overall is outside the feasible scope of the
project.

**Lack of affordable access --** Internet is not only unreliable, but it
is also very expensive where it is available. This contributes to the
predominance of contributions in the official national language and from
a relatively more centralized mainstream user base, rather than the
geographically and linguistically diverse target users.

**Lack of locally relevant and local language content --** There is a
lack of content in other languages. Most articles are written in the
official language of Ethiopia, Amharic. But the platform is designed to
host diverse local languages, and that functionality is not being
exploited. Outreach to other language speakers has been difficult,
mostly because it is expensive and there is a general lack of resources
for the project. Most people only read the articles on the platform, but
do not themselves contribute, and it has been a challenge to motivate
users to actually contribute content of their own.

Sewasew's Suggestions for Future Projects
=========================================

**Tailoring platform to local ICT use preferences helps to promote use
--** Most people in the target user group access the Internet via mobile
devices, so the platform greatly benefits from being tailored to best
serve the target user population in a mobile friendly interface.

**Outreach to local educational and cultural institutions is key to
cultivate communities --** Social media is a great way to reach out to
potential users, but not completely adequate. The scope of the problem
is extensive and its solution may be long-term and multi-generational.
The Sewasew team organizes regular visits to educational and cultural
institutions to introduce the platform and bring awareness to local
content generation.
