Executive Summary 
==================

MOS\@N is a nonprofit initiative that seeks to reduce mother and infant
mortality through improved access to treatment, as well as reduce the
number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who drop out of receiving
treatment by providing accessible treatment and targeted health
information using mobile phones. The pilot project was launched in the
district of Nouna in rural Burkina Faso on 9 January 2013 and completed
on 28 February 2017. It piloted the use of mobile devices to improve the
use of health care services by pregnant women, sending voice medical
appointment reminders and health advice to "godmothers," who act as
community relays to follow up with pregnant women in their respective
villages. In 26 villages, served by five different primary healthcare
centers, MOS\@N brings together various stakeholders, including pregnant
women, godmothers, rural primary healthcare centers (PHCs), health
workers, technicians, and public health researchers.

Context
=======

According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso had a fertility rate of 5.4
children per woman in 2015, with the infant mortality rate at 53 per
thousand in 2016. A case study from the African Strategies for Health
(ASH) project highlighted that the maternal mortality rate in Burkina
Faso was quite high -- at 341 deaths per 100,000 childbirths, 80 percent
of which are preventable. Amnesty International considers discrimination
in access to adequate and timely sexual and reproductive health care
services as the main reason for these deaths.

Under a subsidy policy, 80 percent of the cost of delivery has been
subsidized for women in Burkina Faso, or even offered for free, with the
costs covered for prenatal visits and transportation for labor. These
benefits, however, have not been widely publicized. Poverty and the
geographic divide further discriminate women from receiving adequate
care. Additionally, the distant health facilities and shortage of staff
and supplies also pose serious challenges for pregnant women and their
families.

The literacy rate among adults in Burkina Faso was 35 percent in 2014,
and only 26 percent among women, according to the World Bank. Little is
known about the country's digital literacy rates and digital use,
although a recent World Bank report noted that there are now more mobile
phones than toilets in Africa. Nevertheless, improved access to
information and healthcare services are real challenges for Burkina Faso
just like other developing countries. The Burkina Faso Ministry of
Health (MOH) introduced the national Maternal Death Surveillance and
Response (MDSR) system and guidelines in 2012 to reduce maternal
mortality and improve the timely report of maternal deaths. Other
nonprofits, such as Family Care International, have been active in
strengthening the grassroots organizations and training social workers
as well as villagers to raise awareness of maternal health care and
improve maternal service delivery.

Project Description
===================

MOS\@N, an experimental mobile health (mHealth) network that provides
medical monitoring and follow-up of pregnant women, was implemented in
2013 in response to a critical situation for the health of mothers and
infants as well as PLHIV in the Nouna district of Burkina Faso.
MOS\@N**[,]{.smallcaps}** a fusion of the words "mobile" and "santé"
(health in French), operates in an area where maternal mortality remains
a major public health challenge, and where the rates of antenatal care
consultation attendance and assisted delivery are relatively low.

"Marraines" (godmothers) have become central players in health education
and mobilization -- roles previously played by male community health
workers. They are older women chosen by village leaders to accompany
women through their pregnancy and childbirth, who act as intermediaries
between their community and health workers. MOS\@N has also empowered
women to make decisions about their health and that of their children.
These accomplishments reflect strong community engagement in the
project.

The godmothers have been equipped with bicycles and mobile phones to
facilitate their movement within the village as they travel to the local
Primary Health Centers (PHCs. The mobile phone contains pre-recorded
health education messages for godmothers to play when convening maternal
health awareness sessions. Equipped with phones and data connectivity,
godmothers can reach remote populations to provide them with health
advice and information.

MOS\@N also includes an electronic health record system at PHCs. Since
none of the local PHCs are connected to the electricity grid, they were
also provided solar panels to power the computers for maintenance of
records. Five clinics have been equipped with an interactive voice
server for awareness-raising and appointment reminders, staff with
laptops with a patient monitoring platform installed; and mobile
telecommunications resources to reach out to community stakeholders with
their own phones in order to make sure that communities have access to
adequate, affordable, and fair healthcare services.

Health workers, nurses, and midwives at PHCs are in charge of entering
patient data into the system, which then automatically generates the
reminders sent to the godmothers' phones. The solution places a greater
emphasis on community engagement to deliver treatments, monitor patients
within the community, deliver awareness-raising messages, and reminders
using mobile telecommunications. The community's role has been
consolidated, unlike in the traditional healthcare system where only
healthcare professionals perform this role. The project serves 26
villages across five health facilities. Godmothers were at the heart of
the work, with 52 recruited to raise the awareness of mothers and to
encourage them to seek healthcare. Ten other health workers were
entrusted with HIV follow-up as well. The MOS\@N network also includes
50 health officers and 38 resource persons.

The project was implemented by the Centre de Recherche en Santé de Nouna
(CRSN), a national health research center, and funded by Canada's
International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the Ministry of
Health.

Progress and Results
====================

Since its launch, the project has served 1,330 users per year, with a
total of 3,989 beneficiaries. Ongoing training during monthly monitoring
visits helped hone health workers' technical skills in using the system
and in understanding message content. In all, more than 90 health
workers and 62 community members were trained.

The introduction of mHealth services was warmly welcomed at all levels,
from the local community to the central Ministry of Health. The project
had to overcome the major social challenges, especially around social
stigma. Women do not have decision-making power about many issues in
their family, including healthcare. The strategy was to foster education
and communication at all levels: in the home, between spouses, in
villages, in health centers, and in community health associations. The
participation of husbands was also sought to implement the project. The
project has enhanced the status of women health workers by overcoming
deep-seated gender biases.

Providing godmothers with mobile phones and bicycles helped raise their
social, economic, and professional status in the community. Mobile phone
ownership, accompaniment, and health education sessions have brought
godmothers considerable social recognition too by changing the way they
are perceived. Some are called "doctors," or are given small presents.
It also increased their ability to make decisions within their own
homes. Due to their recruitment and training, they were able to assume
activities such as vaccination promotion that was previously conducted
by male health workers. As a result, godmothers and the women they serve
are now empowered to make decisions about their health and that of their
children.

MOS\@N has generated measurable public health outcomes showing
significant improvement in antenatal attendance and assisted delivery
rates in participating villages. The numbers testify to the project's
success in strengthening the health system and improving access to care.
By the end of 2016, 2,161 pregnant women had received prenatal care.
Assisted childbirths increased by 50 percent to 97.5 percent. Close to
260 patients living with HIV had been tracked by health workers and the
dropout rate was low -- only 1.6 percent of cases.

MOS\@N also increased equity and participation in health governance.
Women were central to the project's implementation, and helped determine
the maternal and child health services offered. Stronger direct contacts
with the health centers and ready access to information will help them
maintain the gains made.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of consistent access--** The main challenge of the project was
unreliable and poor connectivity. Rural villages in Nouna did not have
the cellular access or connectivity anticipated, and the lack of allied
infrastructure in terms of power hampered effectiveness.

**Poor road conditions --** Nouna suffers from a severe rainy season
during which roads become largely impassable. People were obliged to
leave their motos and walk, and forced to pay transportation costs to
take a canoe. This hindered the mobility of godmothers and the women
they serve and required innovative solutions to bridge the gaps in the
health program MOS\@N implemented.

**Overworked health professionals --** The MOS\@N system relies on health
professionals to collate and input all of the data generated by the
godmothers. Health workers sometimes lack time to enter health data into
the computer, and compromise monitoring efforts. Additionally,
godmothers generally do not receive the automatic reminders on time due
to poor connectivity. They may spend hours on the road every day
depending on where they live.

**Gender barriers ­--** Many women in the area have limited access to
mobile phones, and in many cases, husbands, or other members of the
family have a phone, but women are given very little opportunity to use
it. Deep-rooted paternalistic social values in the community also lead
many men to forbid their wives to "waste their time" at the health
center when they could be working in the fields. Godmothers themselves
mentioned that their mHealth duties could be a source of conflict within
the household. To avoid disagreements, only women whose husbands had
consented were selected. Community women were also given the choice of
listing or not listing their phone number in the system to receive
calls.

**Social hierarchies --** Godmothers were often resented because in these
communities there is privacy and secrecy about the pregnancy. Women are
afraid that their babies will be bewitched. Godmothers were, for
instance, accused of revealing confidential information. The
confidential nature of pregnancy, the age of godmothers (in some cases
younger than the women they follow), jealousy over the choice of the
godmother (and her stipend and equipment), and health complications may
all contribute to social tensions.

**HIV Stigma --** The fear of stigma and rejection caused HIV-positive
patients to migrate from village to village, making monitoring of these
patients incredibly challenging.

**Lack of access to health facilities and devices --** Obstacles to
accessing maternal care include distance to health centers, shortages of
skilled health staff, lack of information on sexual and reproductive
health, and the high costs of medical treatments. Health information
provided to pregnant women and health providers is often not delivered
at the right time or is not up-to-date, and women often live between 5
and 10 kilometers from the nearest centers. Further, access to mobile
devices was also at times challenging, as these devices were not as
portable and could not be easily used while traversing difficult
terrain.


MOS\@N's Suggestions for Future Projects
=========================================

**mHealth initiatives must be designed in ways that are bottom-up
--** Successful initiatives require working with on the ground social
conditions, understanding extant social roles that are obstacles to
health care provision as well as extant social roles that can be
translated into facilitating access. MOS\@N radically transformed over
the course of the project. For instance, the role of godmothers changed
over time and the technology used changed vastly.

**Implementing mobile health project requires close monitoring and
adaptation --** MOS\@N shows how complex and multi-layered the
appropriation of mHealth projects can be. The projects may not develop
as intended, and therefore the project team should monitor what is
working and what is not and be able to revise the project in ways that
would better address the needs of the community it is serving.

**Old-fashioned technologies can supplement or replace new technologies,
especially with a poor infrastructure --** One example is that where
infrastructure is lacking, empowering community members to serve as
information conduits can be extremely effective. Other than that, ICTs
combined with "old-fashioned" technologies like bicycles can cover
ground that is too remote or expensive to support through other means.
Finally, solar recharging systems were installed in health centers and
provided to community health workers to counter the erratic electricity
supply. When the Internet could not be accessed, data was stored on
thumb drives and later uploaded into the central server at project
headquarters.
