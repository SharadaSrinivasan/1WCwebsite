Executive Summary  {#executive-summary .ListParagraph}
==================

Virginia Broadband (VABB), founded in 2003, seeks to close the Internet
gap in central and eastern Virginia, a sparsely populated area with
hilly terrain. They deliver fixed terrestrial wireless Internet service
using stand-alone utility poles called "microspots," or wireless
broadcast locations. They use existing vertical structures to support
this technology to repeat its Internet signal and reach remote rural
areas, and build VABB serves large agri-business and tourism farms,
federally employed telecommuters and households living below the poverty
level. They have 30 microspots currently installed, and they have
received an Microsoft Affordable Access grant for nine utility poles.

Context {#context .ListParagraph}
=======

The United States is one of the countries with the highest amount of
Internet users, with a wide disparity between urban and rural users.
Additionally, demographic groups with higher levels of education and
income are more likely to go online than other groups. According to the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the
persistence of the urban-rural divide, even with the increasing
availability of smartphones and social media, suggests that the barriers
for Internet adoption in rural areas are complex.

In 2015, 78.2 percent of households in the eastern coastal U.S. state of
Virginia accessed the Internet through a broadband subscription. Yet, a
2016 Virginia Chamber of Commerce study found only 55 percent of homes
had access to high-speed broadband in rural areas. The national
broadband map recently created by the NTIA showed that Virginia ranked
40^th^ in terms of the percentage of residents in proximity to access
points with broadband speeds of 3 megabits per second (Mbps) or greater,
down from 37^th^ in 2013. There have been some initiatives to extend
coverage in rural Virginia, however, both by local institutions -- such
as the telecommunications company Mid-Atlantic Broadband Communities
Corporation (MBC) -- and technology companies like Microsoft via its
Affordable Access Initiative -- which aims to support, grow, and scale
innovative businesses that are developing technologies such as
television white space (TVWS) to close the digital divide globally.

Project Description {#project-description .ListParagraph}
===================

VABB is a wireless Internet service provider (WISP) utilizing fixed
wireless technology in both unlicensed and licensed radio frequencies.
Their mission is to provide high-speed Internet to the un-served and
under-served rural areas of central and eastern Virginia. VABB employs
14 full-time employees serving more than 1,500 customers in 14
predominantly rural Virginia counties.

VABB's headquarters and main Network Operation Center (NOC) is located
in Culpeper, VA. Professional network engineers, field technicians,
certified tower climbers, and a customer care team staff the VABB NOC.
The VABB management team (CEO, director of operations, and director of
sales) consists of the three original founders of the company. The VABB
NOC also acts as the network hub of the VABB wireless network. All
Internet traffic from their Central Virginia network wirelessly travels
to the VABB NOC's rooftop. From there, fiber-optic internal cabling
delivers the Internet traffic to three diverse fiber-optic carriers with
three diverse routes that terminate in VABB's data center.

VABB utilizes a variety of Microspot broadcast structures to reach deep
into rural Virginia. Microspots are any willing vertical structure with
standard electricity nearby that is tall enough to clear the 70-foot
trees, and the top is able to see another VABB broadcaster. In many
areas of VABB's service area, a total of only five-to-10 houses within
reach of the wireless technology is common. Creative use of existing
local vertical assets, such as silos, barns, houses on hills, and grain
elevators, helps to reach many of these remote homes. When these
vertical structures do not exist, however, the best Microspot option is
a stand-alone utility pole, which offers a service radius of 1-2 miles.
The Microsoft grant the project recently received will support
installing nine such poles.

Sites are supplied by standard power utilities and must be located
within 300 feet of an electrical source. They do not use solar power
because it is still too expensive within Virginia to implement. There
are currently 30 microspots, and they are adding nine more with the
funding from Microsoft. Microspots are strategically placed to reach the
maximal amount of users, with a minimum of five homes per microspot, an
average of 10 homes, and a largely untapped capacity for serving up to
120 houses. They offer service on various use-based plans to individual
households as well as business campuses.

The primary service counties are Culpeper, Orange, Madison, Richmond,
Westmoreland, Lancaster, and Northumberland. They also serve the fringes
of Fauquier, Rappahannock, Greene, Louisa, Spotsylvania, Essex, and
Middlesex counties.

Progress and Results {#progress-and-results .ListParagraph}
====================

There are currently 30 microspots with nine more on the way serving 105
locations. The program serves seven primary counties and seven
additional counties. Most recipients of service are members of
low-to-middle income populations. The program serves people of all ages,
but especially households with school-aged children who are expected to
use the Internet for homework, as well as elderly and/or disabled
individuals who want to access telemedicine services online. VABB's
pricing plans are use-based, rather than speed-based. A majority of
users access the Internet for streaming and television purposes. They
provide free limited-speed Internet service to a few schools, with aims
to expand to more pending sufficient funding. The Microsoft grant
generated some publicity for the project, and landowners in the region
have stepped forward to offer their resources and location to host
additional poles.

Challenges {#challenges .ListParagraph}
==========

**Geographical barriers --** As a rural WISP, VABB faces many technical,
geographic, and marketing challenges when trying to reach deep into
rural areas they serve. The majority of homes and businesses are nestled
within tree forests, behind rolling mountains, on hilltops, and in deep
hollows.

**Sparse population** -- The microspots have a capacity to serve up to
120 houses per pole, but they typically serve between 5-10 only. The
extremely sparse population numbers make it difficult to optimize
service, with a high overhead to acquire only a few customers.

**Economic diversity --** There is a wide range of economic diversity
among the clientele, from very high- to very low-income levels living
side-by-side. So, devising a service that can meet the needs of all the
interested users makes for a challenging business model.

Vabb's Suggestions For Future Projects  {#vabbs-suggestions-for-future-projects .ListParagraph}
=======================================

**Planning and prioritizing community engagement is important --** Their
experience suggests its advantageous to prioritize happy customers and
community engagement, rather than upsetting clients, by having a system
in place before implementing the technology. Some people are in great
need while others are in higher density areas, and so it is a constant
quandary as to whether to prioritize the most numerous or the most
needy. Making direct human connections is an important business strategy
as well as a pleasant interpersonal engagement philosophy.

**Collaborations with various stakeholders is useful --**VABB has
relationships with local organizations, as well as with national,
regional, and international organizations. This includes the Wireless
Internet Service Providers Association, which is a useful information
source for cost effective hardware and equipment.

**Backhaul is a limiting factor** -- The cost of backhaul for the
project is so high that it limits the sustainability and scalability of
the project.
