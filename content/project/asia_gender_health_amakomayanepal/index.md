# Executive Summary 

Amakomaya is a web and mobile application to help women in Nepal address
the challenges of prenatal care, pregnancy, and maternal mortality. A
team of local engineers and healthcare professionals developed Amakomaya
after being awarded a US\$ 4,000 grant from the Internet Society (ISOC)
in 2011. Once a woman sets up her free profile on the application, she
receives audio, video, and text content suited to her stage of
pregnancy. These materials are accessible through mobile phones and can
be downloaded. So far, Amakomaya has reached 11 communities, and 1,077
women have taken advantage of its materials. Amakomaya is an example of
leveraging ICTs to improve public health of a vulnerable population.

Context
=======

Nepal has significantly lowered the number of maternal deaths during
childbirth in the last decade. However, pregnancy and delivery-related
causes are still among the top reasons for maternal mortality in Nepal.
Communicable diseases during pregnancy and maternal, prenatal, and
nutrition conditions accounted for 24 percent of the causes of death for
the country's annual mortality rate in 2015, which is a drop from 46
percent in 2000, but remains higher than the world's average rate of
21.2 percent.

Nearly 68.3 percent women received prenatal care in 2014, the highest
rate over two decades. Traditionally, prenatal care is underrated in
Nepal as pregnancy is considered natural. Most children are delivered at
home, especially in rural areas. Only a fraction of these deliveries had
the presence of skilled birth attendants. Poverty, lack of
transportation, lack of knowledge, prevailing norms and superstitious
beliefs, and gender inequality are some of the main reasons for
inadequate prenatal care.

Little information is available on how pregnant women access health
information in Nepal. There is a wide gap in utilizing prenatal care
services between women of more educated and affluent backgrounds in
urban areas and women of lower socio-economic status living in rural
areas, as the distribution of information among these groups of women is
uneven. Improving access to delivery care and enhancing women's
knowledge about health issues has been recommended by researchers and
policymakers to improve maternal health care in Nepal.

Project Description
===================

Named after a Nepali phrase for *a Mother's Love,* Amakomaya is an
application that focuses on maternal and newborn health and provides
pregnancy- and prenatal care-related information using the Internet and
mobile technologies. The platform seeks to inform low-income women
during and after their pregnancy and child delivery period. Once a woman
creates a free profile and enters her approximate conception date, she
is provided with audio, text, and video materials. Currently, this
includes five videos dubbed in Nepali language, 19 audio recordings, and
several text-based messages. All of these materials can be downloaded.
The application also encourages the participation of family members by
focusing certain materials toward them.

Amakomaya has a built-in button for women to connect and speak to
emergency services. Amakomaya maintains a 24-hour call center to ensure
that women can receive a live response during an emergency. The center
uses Google Maps to triangulate the location of the woman and identify
the health center nearest to her.

Amakomaya has both local and international partnerships to support its
program. The project is funded predominantly through community grants in
2012 and 2013 by Internet Society and Information Society Innovation
Fund (ISIF) Asia respectively. In addition, a local nonprofit
organization, The Patan Academy of Health Science (PAHS), which aims to
improve the health conditions in rural areas by training health workers,
developed and provided pregnancy-relevant information for Amakomaya.
Furthermore, Amakomaya has a partnership with the Washington DC based
nonprofit organization VaxTrac, which focuses on improving the quality
of vaccine data through the use of technology. This pilot project is
also supported by World Health Organization and UNICEF as well as by the
Child Health Division under the Ministry of Health and Population in
Nepal.

Progress and Results 
=====================

Amakomaya is currently available in 11 communities with 1,100 users. It
has trained 90 female community health volunteers (FCHVs). These FCHVs
have reported that the women they work with have been more receptive to
their teaching with the aid of the application.

The number of women seeking prenatal care at community health posts has
increased dramatically after the launch of the application. One such
location, the Jhuwani Community Library, showed an increase in the
number of women seeking antenatal care. Because the content can be
downloaded and is accessible on mobile, it is available at all times and
accessible offline.

Data from the Amakomaya application is available to local public health
officials for targeted action. Amakomaya's success has brought it to the
attention of the Nepalese government and the creators of the application
have been invited to contribute to the nation's first e-health strategy.

Challenges
==========

**Low-level of access --** Many health clinics are a day's travel from a
pregnant woman's community. Coupled with rugged terrain and lack of
transportation, it can be very difficult for women to access these
clinics. Access to the Internet within these regions is easier
comparatively, although there are still challenges to consistent
coverage.

**Lack of awareness --** Because pregnancy is considered a natural part
of the life cycle and a gift from a deity, many women do not believe
they need prenatal or pregnancy care. This poses challenges to
Amakomaya's adoption. Further, cultural traditions and practices situate
women as low status in Nepali society, and one-in-three married women do
not make their own healthcare choices.

Amakomaya's Suggestions for Future Projects
===========================================

**Public-private partnerships are key --** Amakomaya's deployment is
cost-efficient and the project's low operating expenses makes
scalability a realizable intention with government support.

**Accommodating cultural variances is important for improving take-up
--** Due to the cultural conventions of Nepal, many women are unaware of
the necessity of prenatal care. Many community health volunteers report
that local women are skeptical of their instruction as well. When
face-to-face conversations have been preempted or supported by the
educational materials on Amakomaya, however, workers report that women
are more receptive.
