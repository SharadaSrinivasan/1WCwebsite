Executive Summary 
==================

Wireless Leiden has been a nonprofit provider of open-source, wireless
networking since 2002 in the Netherlands. As of 2017, Wireless Leiden
estimates 110 wireless servers have been installed in an area stretching
from Amsterdam to Delft. One of the first community Wi-Fi networks of
its kind, Wireless Leiden is run by volunteers and financed by local
sponsors. Wireless Leiden presents a case that it is possible to build a
community wireless network with the use of relatively low-cost
technologies and open source software despite the technical problems,
loosely-connected volunteers, or limited government support.

Context
=======

Wireless Leiden is based in Leiden, a city and municipality in South
Holland, the Netherlands. The city of Leiden and its surroundings is
spread across 25 square kilometers, which is mostly flat with no
geographical challenges. The population is approximately 123,000, while
the population of the entire Leiden urban area is approximately 350,000.
The average income per household is more than \$27,000 per year.

According to an Internet inclusivity survey conducted by *The
Economist*, the Netherlands scores high overall with regards to Internet
inclusivity and availability. This is due, at least in part, to
widespread 4G telecommunications service coverage and relatively high
fixed broadband and mobile subscription rates -- at 41.73 per 100 people
and 124 per 100 people, respectively.

Project Description 
===================

Wireless Leiden is a nonprofit organization that builds and maintains an
open-source wireless network in western Netherlands. It has been
operational since 2002, and its services are intended for populations
whose access to regular Internet connectivity is difficult or
impossible. In many cases, this means the target population is rural. In
other cases, the target population is itinerant (e.g., students,
boaters, or campers), or temporary (e.g., those whose regular Internet
connection is down). As Internet infrastructure has become more readily
available, they have more intentionally focused on providing Internet to
low-income users.

Wireless Leiden capitalizes on the 13 radio channels that operate within
the 2.4-gigahertz (GHz) frequency band, which are allocated within the
Netherlands for radio local area networks.Â The network is local, but
does provide the possibility to connect to the Internet. It operates via
interconnected wireless servers to which individual users connect via
antennae and USB Wi-Fi adaptor. This significantly decreases monthly or
other regularly operational costs, making it very cost-effective. The
nodes are placed at strategic locations based on the needs of the users,
local institutions and architecture. Individual users are responsible
for procuring and building their own connection hardware.

Wireless Leiden has no government affiliation or subsidy, but instead
partners with patrons in order to provide connectivity as no cost to
most of its users. It relies entirely on volunteer labor and expertise,
and makes extensive use of community resources, corporate sponsorships,
and institutional partnerships. Wireless Leiden also attempted to set up
a network set-up in rural Turkey.

Progress and Results 
====================

By identifying win-win opportunities for the material and social
benefits of wireless connectivity, Wireless Leiden effectively networks
disparate social groups and institutions in order to provide
wide-ranging benefits. For example, wealthy members of a yachting marina
wanted Internet access in a remote location where Internet cables had
not been installed. By connecting the financial capital of the wealthy
yacht owners with the willingness of a local church to host the servers
(at the yachters' cost), Wireless Leiden was able to provide free
wireless connectivity to the surrounding local village. In another
instance, the Heineken brewery provided free hosting and antennae
placement on their relatively tall infrastructure in exchange for
advertising. Wireless Leiden also has ongoing partnerships with the
local university, in which students use the networks to develop projects
and software beneficial to their studies, the community, and Wireless
Leiden itself.

Wireless Leiden' emphasis on open, local connectivity led users
overwhelmingly to use the local network to then access a connection to
the Internet. The ability to survey remote areas or outposts via webcam
is also a valuable social, economic, and environmental resource for
those living and working in rural areas and occupations. For instance,
webcams allows farmers to keep an eye on their crops and tulip gardens.
Moreover, connectivity enables fishermen and anglers to check out the
weather conditions and plan their trips.

Challenges 
==========

**Volunteers --** Wireless Leiden is completely volunteer-run and
organized. While this has kept costs low, it has also presented
challenges. Each project is motivated by a volunteer willing to take on
the labor of that project. This means that connectivity is dependent on
the whims of volunteers and thus the spread of the network is ad-hoc,
without overarching logic or priority. Finally, with the increasing need
for volunteers due to growth of the network, it becomes difficult to
manage them who come with their own system of doing things.

**Physical maintenance --** As the network grows, so do challenges to
maintaining its physical components. While Wireless Leiden has a very
effective update and troubleshooting system for its software components,
the network's dependence on wireless servers requires maintenance visits
every so often -- at a minimum, once every two years. The lack of a
regular workforce with adequate skills means that this maintenance is
difficult to accomplish and thus poses challenges to the growing
network's sustainability within the limits of Wireless Leiden' current
structure of operations.

**Security --** The network is completely unsecured at the network
infrastructure level, with individual users responsible for their
Internet security and protection. Leiden Wireless maintains, "Security
is the responsibility of the user." This leaves users, especially those
with little knowledge or experience of how or why their privacy might be
compromised on the Internet, vulnerable to surveillance or phishing, for
example.

Wireless Leiden's Suggestions for Future Projects 
=================================================

**Facilitation is key --** While they handle all the labor of server
installation and implementation, Wireless Leiden's main activity is
facilitation. The organization emphasizes connecting demand with supply
in areas that lack infrastructural development by Internet providers.

**Diversity in expertise may help in the long term --** A successful
project launch of this kind may benefit from carefully assembling a
sufficiently diverse team of experts. Wireless Leiden sought out experts
who could speak to each integral component of the project: computer
software and hardware, "radio amateurs" with expertise in antennae
building and placement, database managers and information technology
professionals, and those with experience in industrial relations and
business. Wireless Leiden reports that similar projects beginning around
the same time (in San Francisco, California, Portland, Oregon, and
Seattle, Washington) relied too heavily on the experience and oversight
of software developers alone and failed to establish a sustainable
network.

**Scalablity should be baked in from the start --** Significant to this
project's success is their emphasis on accurate documentation and good
database management. From its small-scale beginnings in 2002, Wireless
Leiden was immediately advised of the importance of standardizing both
software and hardware. They began their organization with a
well-organized central database and a robust monitoring method for rapid
long-distance troubleshooting, and thus were able to sustainably grow
the network. From this case, however, it is clearly apparent that it is
important to also create an equally sustainable method of physical
maintenance for widespread hardware components.

**Community involvement is key --** This case presents an example of
what it takes to build a community wireless network despite the lack of
government support or funding. As the maintenance challenges of their
network's spread continue, however, it may be advisable to seek some
form of partnership with government programs in order to address the
long-term needs of sustaining wireless servers. In addition, government
involvement in planning a project of this type may be more or less
advisable depending on the country in question, geographic conditions,
available resources, Internet policies or non-community oriented
cultures. For instance, Wireless Leiden' attempted network set-up in
rural Turkey was only successful until the Turkish government
intervened, objecting to a private network alternative to local
corporations and state-controlled communications (phone, Internet,
etc.). Wireless Leiden's methods present a potentially compelling case
for freedom of communication in contexts where the state may have strong
financial and/or political interest in centralized communication
infrastructures.
