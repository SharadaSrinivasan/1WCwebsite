Executive Summary 
==================

Give1 Project Gambia is a not-for-profit organization that organizes All
Girls Tech camps across Gambia. The project trains young girls aged
13-20 in web design, computer graphics, coding, and database design.
Leading women in technology in Gambia give career talks and advice to
youth, as part of the tech camp. The initiative brings girls from across
the country to participate in training programs, develop information and
communications technology (ICT) skills, and be paired with an
entrepreneurial mentor. Currently, the initiative serves five schools
and provides free training, food, and transportation costs to
participants.

Context
============

The Gambia is the smallest country on the African continent and among
its poorest. According to the United Nations Development Program's
(UNDP) Human Development Index in 2013, the mean years of schooling for
Gambians aged 25 and older was only 2.8 years. Adult literacy was lower
among females at 45 percent, as compared to 62 percent in males. The low
literacy rate has especially hindered the opportunities available to
young women in Gambia.

The Gambian government has strived to adopt ICTs into the national
education development framework by partnering with private donors, the
public sector, and civil society organizations. In 2016, the Ministry of
Basic and Secondary Education, with support from World Bank, launched
the project called "Connect-a-school; Connect-a-community" to build six
ICT centers in the town of Bakau to provide access to information for
underrepresented groups. Nonprofit organizations also promote ICTs in
Gambia in many ways. For instance, in 2017, a new Mozilla Club of
Hackathon Girls was established in Banjul, the capital of Gambia, to
empower girls by providing access to technology resources and web
literacy.

Project Description
===================

The All Girls Tech Camp was launched in 2015 to train young girls in
urban and rural areas of Gambia in ICT skills. Educational programs
offered at the tech camps include basic ICT skills for beginners, and
more advanced training in developing apps, web design, JavaScript, and
coding. Volunteer instructors from technology teams are responsible for
visiting schools and organizing camps.

The initiative brings girls from across the country to participate in
training programs. The camp provides opportunities to learn new skills
and develop critical thinking and problem-solving techniques. The
pedagogy integrates leadership and entrepreneurial sessions to empower
women to start enterprises as well. After each training session, youth
participants are assigned to a mentor who encourages and monitors
performance. The mentor provides guidance to youth to become a mature
woman entrepreneur.

The Tech Camp seeks to empower young women in the ICT sector and raises
awareness about opportunities in ICTs. Social media and television
publicity about the camps promotes awareness as well. At the end of each
camp, an award ceremony is organized with a Give1 Empowerment talk on
the importance of ICT training for girls in Gambia and Africa at large.

Progress and Results
====================

All Girls Tech Camps have been organized at five schools in Gambia and
trained more than 500 girls and young women between the ages of 13 and
20.

After a year of operation, All Girls TechCamp won the Gold Fire Award
for innovation in Africa, enabling the project to scale up its
initiative and expand to other schools in Gambia. They also won a Google
grant for US\$ 7,000 to support this effort in 2016. As part of the
condition of the grant, US\$ 4,000 was used as a travel grant to the
2016 Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in Guadalajara, Mexico, and US\$
3,000 was used for the training.

At present, Give1 Project is working to create training modules for
prisoners in collaboration with the Minister of the Interior. This
project is pending due to financial constraints.

They are promoting awareness of the initiative and of the importance of
ICT training for girls in Gambian and Africa at large via television and
social media, especially Facebook.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding --** The organization reports that demand
from the students is high, but there are not enough resources to enroll
all of them. A monthly operating cost of \$2,000 would be ideal to
maintain the project but is not consistently available. Therefore,
scaling the project requires additional funding.

**Lack of access to** **devices --** Less than 2 percent of the girls in
Gambia have access to computers at home, and schools are equipped with
limited computer labs. Schools need more computers, and students need
resources outside of school to maintain the skills learned at the camp.

Give1 Project's Suggestions for Future Projects
===============================================

**Pairing ICT skills development with entrepreneurship training for
women has the capacity to create pathways for women empowerment --** The
Give1 Project combines ICT skill training with entrepreneurship and
leadership training to provide young girls in Gambia with a holistic way
forward toward empowerment through ICTs.

**ICT education is growing in demand, but often faces critical capacity
and funding constraints that must be addressed --** Young people see the
value of acquiring ICT skills, and as reported by the organization, show
an interest in attending these camps. However, people cannot develop ICT
skills without access to the technologies they require both within
schools and outside them, long after the camps have been conducted.
Their experience suggests that schools would benefit from access to
technology resources that are apace with modern ICT curricula.
