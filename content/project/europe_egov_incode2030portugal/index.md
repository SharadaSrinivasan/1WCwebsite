Executive Summary 
==================

INCoDe.2030 is an integrated public policy broad initiative aiming to
enhance digital competences and advancing the use of digital
technologies in Portugal. In response to the problem of Portugal lagging
behind in European Union (EU) averages for information and
communications technology (ICT) adoption, the program outlines
multi-step targets for digital education and research. By 2030, the
initiative aims to increase digital inclusion for universal exercise of
citizenship, to expand digital opportunities in qualifying for and
seeking employment, and to produce new knowledge through international
collaboration. Portugal has previously deployed contained programs in
digital literacy and education. Over the course of 20 years, these
programs have had measured success. With the experience and knowledge
gained from these projects, this new broader initiative is able to apply
lessons learned as well as overcome the limitations of discrete ICT
outreach by providing more systemic support.

Context
=======

The Europe\'s Digital Progress Report (EDPR) showed that Portugal ranked
15^th^ out of 28 EU Member States in the 2017 Digital Economy and
Society Index (DESI). In 2016, 26 percent of Portuguese citizens never
used the Internet, which was much higher than the EU average of 14
percent. Furthermore, 52 percent of the Portuguese population does not
have basic digital skills and 30 percent have no digital skills at all,
compared with the EU average of 44 percent and 19 percent, respectively.
The share of adults in the active labor force with no digital skills in
Portugal is twice as high as the EU average as well -- at 22 percent.
According to the same report, the digital gap remained among the
elderly, lower income, and less educated groups of the population. Thus,
raising its population's digital competences has become one of the key
challenges for Portugal to overcome in order to catch up with other EU
nations.

The Government of Portugal established the National Strategy for Digital
Inclusion and Literacy and enabled several initiatives to promote
digital inclusion and improve digital competences. One of the
initiatives is the ICT and Society Network, a multi-stakeholder national
platform with more than 500 members that promotes the adoption of
computers and improvement of digital literacy to reduce the digital
divide. The Choices Program, created in 2001 with a goal to promote
social and digital inclusion, has served a great number of children and
youth in the most vulnerable communities. The Portuguese Coalition for
Digital Jobs also launched the Digital Employability Strategy and Action
Plan 2015-2020 to increase the number of ICT specialists and promote
digital skills of the labor force.

Project Description
===================

INCoDe.2030 is an initiative that seeks to improve digital competences
in Portugal, as well as advance the country's capacity for advanced
research in and through the use of digital technologies. Six government
ministries are collaborating in the organization and deployment of the
constitutive programs: The Ministry of Presidency and Administrative
Modernization, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education;
the Ministry of Education; the Ministry of Labor, Solidarity and Social
Security; the Ministry of Planning and Infrastructures and the Ministry
of Economy. These ministries -- along with other public and private
institutions and organizations in Portugal, across Europe, and elsewhere
in the world that are involved in the initiative -- work along five axes
to achieve set goals of digital literacy and development:

**Inclusion** **--** The initiative aims to create an accessible
Internet commons, increasing access through fixed and mobile sites to
guarantee widespread connectivity. It also aims to build an easy-to-use
platform where people can navigate available resources.

**Education --** ICT curricula are in development for both teachers and
students.

**Qualification --** The initiative qualification is aimed widely at the
entire population and narrowly at certain sectors of the workforce that
could benefit specifically from ICT training. With access to
e-government resources and online qualification programs, anyone will be
able to benefit. With specialty training in digital methods and
platforms, government employees and private businesses can both improve
their economic practices and service relationships.

**Specialization --** By offering short courses as well as digitally
oriented post-graduate degrees, educational institutions will
collaboratively advance professionalization with ICT skills.

**Research --** The initiative works to promote new advances in research
and development in advanced computing. Major projects include MACC, a
Portuguese supercomputing resource installed by the Foundation for
Science and Technology at the University of Minho in Braga, as part of
collaboration with the University of Texas at Austin.Â

Progress and Results
====================

In late 2017, INCoDe.2030 held the first annual Conference of its
Permanent Forum , bringing together various parties in the public and
private sectors in order to deepen and refine understandings of the
motivations and challenges involved in the initiative. The project is
fully funded for its goals reaching to 2020. They are currently seeking
funding for the 2020-2030 segment of the initiative.

The initiative is building on decades of findings, putting into practice
lessons learned about the varying needs and conditions across the
diverse demographics and geographies of Portugal.

Challenges
==========

**Perceived need for ICT** **competences --** In a country where a
quarter of the population has never used the Internet, it can be a
challenge to some who do not think they need those competences.

**Inter-ministry cooperation --** While the program draws a great deal
of its strength from its support from a variety of government
ministries, it is also challenged by the difficulty of coordinating
priorities among disparate branches of government.

INCoDe.2030's Suggestions for Future Projects
=============================================

**Broader initiatives should learn from past programs --** Portugal has
previously deployed programs in digital literacy and education. Over the
course of 20 years, these programs have had measured success. With the
experience and knowledge gained from these projects, this new broader
initiative is able to apply lessons learned as well as overcome the
limitations of discrete ICT outreach by providing more systemic support.
