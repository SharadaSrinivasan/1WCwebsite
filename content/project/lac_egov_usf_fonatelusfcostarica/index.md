Executive Summary 
==================

The National Telecommunications Fund (FONATEL) is part of
Telecommunications Superintendence (SUTEL), the Costa Rican
telecommunications regulator. FONATEL was created in 2009 as a
consequence of legal provisions that arose from the ratification of the
Free Trade Agreement with the United States in 2007 and the end of Costa
Rica's state monopoly in the telecommunications sector in 2008. The
Universal Service Fund is financed by mandated contributions from
telecommunications operators as well as spectrum allocation tenders.
FONATEL develops and executes a variety of programs to reduce the
digital divide and universalize access to Internet connectivity in Costa
Rica.

Context
=======

Costa Rica is a highly concentrated country, with a majority of its
population centered in the city of San Jose, its capital. One-fourth of
the total population continue to live in poverty. As of 2015, 49.4
percent of Costa Ricans are Internet users. Among the poorest
households, only 19 percent have a computer according to the Encuesta
Nacional de Hogares (Enaho)---National Household Survey published in
July 2015. For rural populations, connectivity is scarce or
non-existent. Internet penetration is 41 percent lower in rural regions
when compared to urban areas.

Despite the breakup of the Costa Rican Internet service provider (ISP)
monopoly after the signing of the Central American Free Trade Agreement
that allowed other providers to potentially service rural regions, a
high cost of service still hampered access to many rural Costa Ricans.
While the number of Internet users increased to 56.4 percent in 2016,
nearly all of this growth is centered among urban areas. In fact, these
numbers are indicative of a widening gap between the wealthiest and
poorest citizens. Even when connectivity is available, speeds are slow.
No area of Costa Rica has at least 5 percent of its connections with
speeds over 15 megabits per second (Mbps), compared to a standard of
approximately 50 percent in developed nations.

Project Description
===================

FONATEL runs five major programs across the country, three of which are
currently active.

The first program focuses on bringing telecommunications infrastructure
to rural areas of Costa Rica and has been active since 2012. These
sparsely populated, low-income areas have been neglected by industry for
their lack of profitable prospects. FONATEL conducts subsidy auctions
among telecom operators in different project areas around the country to
install the necessary infrastructure for individuals to be able to
purchase Internet access. Also part of this program is FONATEL's
provision of free Internet connectivity to rural schools.

The second program, Connectedos Hoagares, has been active since 2016.
This program provides low-income households with significantly
subsidized Internet connections and computers. The Connected Homes
program is an initiative that brings together different state
institutions, including the Vice Presidency, the Rector and Regulator
for Telecommunication. It is implemented by telecommunication companies
and supported by NGOs and is part of the "Bridge to Development
Strategy" of the country. The Universal Service Fund provides the
financial support for the subsidy. The telecommunications service
providers provide both the Internet service as well as the computer
resources and software licenses, engage in program promotion, as well as
provide the requisite e-government applications and digital literacy
training.

The government determines eligible households using criteria such as
whether the household is at or below poverty level, as well as whether
they belong to groups in the fourth and fifth deciles of income but have
specific social needs in order to include the indigenous, differently
abled, female-headed households and self-employed. It provides three
levels of subsidy at 80 percent, 60 percent and 40 percent depending on
their income and special needs, using the ratio of household income to
the cost of internet service and a basic to determine subsidy amounts.

The program, which officially started disbursing subsidies in June 2016,
will invest US\$ 128 million over the course of five years. The subsidy
lasts three years, and covers the cost of a basic computer and an
Internet service at 2 Mbps. FONATEL, the universal service fund, covers
both the cost of the subsidy as well as the service.

The main goal of the Connected Homes program is to combat poverty and
inequity, and promote job creation and economic growth through
increasing access to information technology in vulnerable groups. The
objective is to provide up to 80 percent of subsidy for computer and
broadband to almost 150,000 low income families, around 15 percent of
Costa Rica homes.

The third program is hardware-focused, providing information and
communications technology (ICT) consultation and equipment to public
institutions since early 2016.

The fourth program will provide free public Wi-Fi in public spaces,
including parks, train stations, city centers, and libraries, and a
fifth aims to develop and deploy a fiber-optic network in larger and
more centralized schools.

Progress and Results
====================

Approximately 400 rural schools have been provided with Internet
connectivity paid for by FONATEL. Schools reports that Internet
capabilities have not only streamlined and organized their
administrative capabilities, but also have provided rich supplementary
materials and methods in the classroom. FONATEL has provided 16,000
computers, printers, and network equipment to schools.

As of 2017, 30,000 households have been provided with subsidized
Internet and computers. The long-term goal is to extend this service to
140,000 households.

Not only has the infrastructural development been successful, but rates
of subscription have also has exceeded expectations. FONATEL also notes
that demand for mobile connectivity is much higher than fixed
connectivity.

Challenges
==========

**Bureaucratic state structures --** As an independently operated fund,
but state-affiliated, FONATEL must navigate a fragmented set of
bureaucratic institutions in order to operate according to government
policies and laws. This coordination -- between, for example, the
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Science and Technology, social
security institutions, as well as different local governments Â­-- can be
difficult and often slows the place of progress.

**Difficulties in data collection --** FONATEL has made robust efforts
to collect data on the impact of their programs and meticulously reports
outcomes. Certain obstacles can impede their ability to collect data,
however. For example, the demographic database that supports their
second program is not always updated or accurate. In addition, FONATEL
is still in the process of brainstorming and experimenting with certain
quantitative/qualitative data collection methods and metrics.

FONATEL's Suggestions for Future Projects
=========================================

**Partial subsidies are a better way forward for Universal Funds --**
FONATEL advocates the provision of partial rather than total subsidies
for connectivity and equipment in their program serving low-income
households. The sliding scale system ensures that the service be
sustainably affordable for families, while the financial contribution
creates value relationships between individuals and services.

**Computers and connectivity resources are highly valued by
under-resourced communities and maintained well --** Families to which
FONATEL provides Internet and computers maintain their devices and
connections incredibly well. These low-income families, 95 percent of
which are headed by women, take exceptional care of their computers.
While FONATEL expected a high rate of lost, sold, or stolen computers,
it turns out that this rate is very low. Ethnographers deployed to
observe a selection of these households report that the resources have
been seriously incorporated as educational tools within the home and are
maintained according to the instructions provided with each unit.
