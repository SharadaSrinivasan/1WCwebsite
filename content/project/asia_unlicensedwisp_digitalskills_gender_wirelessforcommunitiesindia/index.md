Executive Summary 
==================

The Wireless for Communities (W4C) program, launched by the Internet
Society and Digital Empowerment Foundation in India in 2009, deploys
community wireless networks to set up and expand connectivity in rural
locations of India and equips community members with training to design,
deploy, and operate wireless networks. The program has benefitted over
120,000 people, trained 100 community members, and connected 246
community information resource centers (CIRCs) in over 18 states of the
country. It has enabled local governments, community radio stations, and
rural weavers to be connected through its efforts. Further, training for
rural entrepreneurs through resource centers such as "Chanderiyaan" as
well as at the Barefoot College have provided employment and benefited
people who wanted to start businesses online. The latest phase of the
project, called Wireless Women for Entrepreneurship & Empowerment
(W2E2), empowers women entrepreneurs through specific capacity building
efforts by providing them training to set up businesses online.

Context
=======

As of 2015, India is home to 18% of the world's population, with over
70% of people continuing to live in villages. Rural teledensity remains
low at 49%. Internet connectivity in rural and tribal districts proves
to be a challenge.

While the government has undertaken a number of supply side efforts to
improve infrastructure, such as the National Optical Fiber Network
(NOFN) Project (recently renamed to BharatNet), progress has been slow.
While the NOFN project began with the ambitious aim connecting 250,000
gram panchayats (local governments) by 2016, as of 2014 it had only
managed to complete its pilot phase in the states of Rajasthan, Tripura,
and Andhra Pradesh. The new Bharatnet project is planned to be
implemented in three phases with a deadline of December 2018.

The slow progress in relation to providing Internet connectivity
especially in the most backward and tribal districts of the country has
prompted a number of innovative approaches to providing Internet access
to these areas.

Project Description
===================

The Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) and Internet Society (ISOC)
launched Wireless for Communities (W4C) in 2010 to address this need.
The program provides connectivity using low-cost Wi-Fi based equipment
and unlicensed spectrum (free spectrum) to rural and under-served
communities.

There are three key components to the program. A training of trainers
(ToT) project equips community members with the skills to deploy as well
as maintain community infrastructure, which makes the project
sustainable in the long term. The deployment of mesh networks in rural
areas that use low cost Wi-Fi infrastructure forms the core of the
project. Skills training and capacity building endeavors in the
community enable community members to use the Internet for enterprise.

The first pilot project was launched in late 2010 in the Chanderi
cluster, highly populated with marginalized handloom weavers, located in
Madhya Pradesh. Relying on the Chanderi Weavers Information Resource
Centre (CWIRC) as its base center, the network connected 13 schools and
40 panchayats (village councils), 2 Madarasas (muslim
universities/schools), a public health center, hotel, as well as a
community radio station. The project set up a separate digital design
resource centre called "Chanderiyaan" where ICT training, certification
and diploma courses are offered to people. These efforts have allowed
villagers to be able to access government services online, and set up
online businesses.

The district of Baran in Rajasthan formed the second phase, where 7
night school-cum-libraries and 8 cluster centers were connected across
202 villages of the district. (Each cluster center covers 8-10
villages.) The third phase connected the village of Giridih in
Jharkhand, Mandla, in Madhya Pradesh and Nangaon, rural North Tripura.
W4C also conducted 18 workshops for the communities coming online. All
of these phases rely unlicensed spectrum and very low cost Wi-Fi
equipment, set up by "barefoot engineers" trained by the Digital
Empowerment Foundation at Barefoot College, Tilonia.

Both campuses of Barefoot College are fully covered by wireless
Internet. E-ticketing, email, and Internet service are provided to
visitors, and staff use this connectivity to sell Tilonia crafts online.

The fifth and sixth phases of the project consolidate already existent
networks in Guna, Shivpuri, and Baran, and expand the scope of the
project to newer regions such as Narayanpet in Telengana.

A component of the project called Wireless Women for Entrepreneurship &
Empowerment (W2E2) identifies women from self-help groups within these
communities and provides them with targeted training. This training
empowers these women, who come from varied backgrounds -- artisans,
weavers, and Anganwadi workers, to name a few -- to become entrepreneurs
by giving them the skills needed to set up and maintain websites for
their services and goods.

Progress and Results
====================

Connectivity in rural areas has transformed information access in
numerous ways for these communities. Wireless for Communities provided
ICT training, certification and diploma courses on computer concepts,
tele-health technology courses at Chanderiyaan. Eleven out of the 13
schools in Chanderi have Wi-Fi connections and computer centers. As a
result of wireless Internet and broadband, the weavers of Chanderi are
taking to e-commerce and Facebook to sell their crafts. In Baran,
digitally enabled services include telemedicine, learning and education
through video conferencing, and narrowcasting of community radio
programs. Barefoot College uses this connectivity to upload villages'
water data online for the purposes of policy advocacy.

Community Information Resource Centers have helped villagers gain access
to data, including exam results of students and online data of all
mid-day meals in the district, as well as enabled people to open bank
accounts and get printouts of Aadhaar (Unique Identification Number)
cards. Unlike many other remote districts in Jharkhand,the school
mid-day meal status is up-to-date in Birni, a block panchayat in Giridh,
as its office uses broadband Wi-Fi connectivity provided by the W4C
program through a local organization called Nav Jagriti Mandal to keep
this information current.

The project has also enabled Sahariya tribal community members in Mandla
to understand the importance of education. A foundation called Sankalp
reaches out to this community using the Wireless for Communities network
in education outreach.

Another benefit of W4C is the availability of telemedicine services at
local public health centers (PHC). The project has provided seamless
internet connectivity that has enabled health care centers in rural
Jharkhand and Tripura to provide telemedicine services and receive
expert advice from doctors through Skype calls.

Challenges
==========

**Access to adequate infrastructure --** The costs to deploy traditional
cell tower infrastructure in some rural areas of the country remains
high, due to the geographic terrain as well as the lack of continuous
access to electricity. Low economic spending power (which results in low
return on investment for service providers) and dispersed communities
form key challenges.

**Capacity and Skills --** Even in areas with infrastructure, people
often lack the skills to use the Internet to its potential. Lack of
content in local languages as well as inadequate ICT training are
reasons for less adoption in rural areas as compared to urban areas.

DEF's Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================

**Training of barefoot engineers for the set-up and maintenance of
networks is helpful** -- Local maintenance can provide sustainable,
low-cost connectivity and enable information access in rural parts of
the country as operational costs for maintenance reduces with local
trained manpower.

**Capacity-building initiatives through Community Information Resource
Centers can empower rural entrepreneurs to leverage the Internet for
e-commerce --** The Digital Empowerment Foundation believes in
leveraging connectivity to provide rural entrepreneurs, especially
women, the ability to reach new markets. The W2E2 program engages in
targeted capacity building efforts for women entrepreneurs, and has
enabled small businesses to flourish online.

**Connectivity to the most rural areas can enable telemedicine and save
lives** -- This has the potential to transform access to healthcare in
areas that are hard to reach traditionally, which currently leads to
delays and loss of lives.
