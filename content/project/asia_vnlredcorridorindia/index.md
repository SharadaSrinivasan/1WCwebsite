Executive Summary  {#executive-summary .ListParagraph}
==================

Vihaan Networks Limited, in partnership with the Ministry of Home
Affairs in India, decided to build a mobile phone network in areas prone
to left-wing extremist violence. This network \-- the world's largest
green mobile network \-- offers voice and mobile data connectivity to
deprived millions in affected Indian states. These regions include some
of the most challenging terrain in the country, with practically no
roads, power or security. Vihaan Networks Limited has helped BSNL set up
2,199 solar-powered mobile communication towers in 18 months, altering
not just the geographical, but the social landscape of the area.

Context {#context .ListParagraph}

The Red Corridor is an area under the influence of Left Wing Extremists
(LWE) or Maoists in India. The groups tend to seek State power by
violent means. Their presence has considerably gone down from nearly 200
districts across 20 states a decade ago to 106 districts across 10
states: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh,
Odisha, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and some northern fringes
of Tamil Nadu.

The Indian government considers the group an internal security threat
and launched counterinsurgency in 2009. Ever since, the number of
casualties, especially civilians, has increased. According to India's
First Post, counterinsurgency experts believed that the problem in
controlling Naxalism lies in "the nature of security forces deployed in
Red Corridor, combat strategy, lack of coordination in sharing of
intelligence inputs between the Centre and the state, and the lack of a
national policy."

Project description {#project-description .ListParagraph}
===================

Left-wing extremists are present in around 10 states of India. These
states are often poor, under-developed, inaccessible and in
heavily-forested regions with almost no infrastructure. The Ministry of
Home Affairs in India decided to set up of a robust communication
network to combat insurgency-hit areas in India's Red Corridor, to
support counter-insurgency operations and promote economic development
in the region.

To address these needs, Vihaan Networks Limited (VNL), a
telecommunication company that develops end-to-end infrastructure
products and solutions, has set up 2,199 mobile communication towers
across 10 affected states in India in 18 months. A majority of these,
1,315 towers, are live and maintained by VNL, which facilitates
innovative wireless communication solutions for rural and remote
locations. The government supports the project as to mainstream
political dialogue, which entails increased information, access to
e-governance, and banking and business opportunities.

Designed and manufactured indigenously, VNL's WorldGSM solution consists
of low-power base-stations beaming 2G voice and data signals within a
radius of 5 km each, networked with the nearest BSNL exchanges. Wireless
backhaul and subscriber management is provided by BSNL. All sites are
solar-powered, with battery-storage for 5 non-sunny days.

Deprived citizens, most living on the edge of poverty, now have a window
to the rest of the world, as they start using mobile phones to connect
with families, employers, doctors, local bureaucrats and politicians.
This connectivity has enabled better education, access to agricultural
inputs and markets, finance and banking, and opened avenues for small
businesses.The project is deployed by VNL and funded by the Universal
Service Fund.

Progress and Results {#progress-and-results .ListParagraph}
====================

The project has connected approximately 18 million citizens across
22,688 villages, of which 3.9 million are mobile connections. The
project is energy-efficient and entirely solar powered.

Connectivity has helped communications, in areas bereft of roads,
railways and electricity. Inhabitants are also able to access
information on agricultural inputs and markets. Banking and other
commercial activities are easily accessible. Emergency and other health
services have been used to save lives. The VNL network also helps
maintain counter-insurgency operations. Security personnel can also stay
in touch with their families.

The provider, BSNL has also made substantial progress to reduce its
carbon footprint by substituting solar energy for traditional power
sources and diesel generators. This has helped save approximately 78,900
tons of carbon dioxide that would have been released into the
environment.

Challenges {#challenges .ListParagraph}
==========

**Land acquisition --** Finding locations that can be appropriated from
the agricultural, foresting, and tribal structure of the service
locations in order to erect infrastructure for broadcast towers is a
challenge.

**Weak allied infrastructure --**The locations being served lack road
service and basic electrical reliability. This makes erecting
communications infrastructure and maintainence doubly hard.

**Disruption by extremists --** Infrastructure is prone to disruptions
by violence and acts of vandalism by extremists. Maintenance and
security in remote locations proves to be a challenge.

VNL's Suggestions for Future Projects {#vnls-suggestions-for-future-projects .ListParagraph}
=====================================

**Communications networks can serve development goals even in high-risk
areas \--** ICT is crucial not just for closing the digital divide but
can also serve to reconfigure social relations and stabilize volatile
political factions.

**Security and maintenance of large networks needs to be accounted for**
-- Theft and vandalism pose a significant threat in high-risk areas.
Security therefore must be given high priority while planning such
projects.
