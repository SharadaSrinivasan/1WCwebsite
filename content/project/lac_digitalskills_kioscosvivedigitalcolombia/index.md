Executive Summary  {#executive-summary .ListParagraph}
==================

Kioscos Vive Digital (KVD) is an Internet access and telecommunications
technology service provider and training program working to close the
digital divide in rural Colombia. The program provides digital kiosks
that act as community Internet access points for children, youth, and
adults in rural areas with more than 100 inhabitants, located in the
most remote areas of Colombia. The kiosks enable anyone using their
services to connect to the Internet, and receive free training in
accessing and using the Internet, computers, and other information and
communications technologies (ICTs). The project operates under the
auspices of the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications
(MinTIC) to provide satellite Internet services to communities that, due
to their geographic remoteness and/or infrastructural limitations, were
not included in the National Optical Fiber Project. Some of the programs
and services outlined in the Universal Service Fund are dependent on
Internet access for their efficacy and availability, so the project
provides the necessary Internet services

Context {#context .ListParagraph}
=======

Colombia is committed to employing ICTs to promote a knowledge society
and modernize the country, as the 10-Year Education Plan 2006-2016, its
"Vision 2019" document, and the National Plan of New Information and
Communication Technologies demonstrate.

The National ICT Plan 2008-2019 proposed a set of policies, actions, and
projects to bring about the efficient and productive use of ICTs among
all Colombians, with the aim to improve social inclusion and increase
competitiveness. Furthermore, MinTIC's National Broadband Policy has
increased the percentage of Colombian municipalities' Internet
connectivity from 17 percent in 2010 to an impressive 96 percent in
2015.

The Ministry of Education has also launched several initiatives to
address digital literacy, including a pilot project to train teachers,
students, and parents with 1,500 donated Intel computers in 2007, and a
project that loosely translates to "Path of ICTs Appropriation."
Launched in 2008, the project aims to increase teachers' professional
development. Moreover, through the 899 Puntos Vive Digital (community
Internet centers), 100,771 people have received digital literacy
training.

Due to the lack of competition, both fixed-line and mobile Internet
services in Colombia are among the most expensive compared to
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.
The average Internet speed in Colombia in 2013 was only 3 megabits per
second (Mbps). High-speed Internet is a luxury product, and only 0.7
percent of the country's broadband connections were faster than 10 Mbps
in 2011, according to the OECD.

The connectivity inequity is particularly severe between urban and rural
areas. Most Colombians live in cities, where the major Internet service
providers (ISPs) are located and hold significant market power. These
telecommunications firms are not interested in expanding the network to
rural areas, leaving the population far behind. The government is
actively organizing several projects to resolve this market failure,
including its 13 billion-peso (US\$ 4.55 million) "Free Wi-Fi for the
People" plan to establish 1,000 free public Wi-Fi spots across the
country.

Project Description {#project-description .ListParagraph}
===================

Kioskos Vive Digital provides satellite Internet connectivity and
services in more than 7,000 rural Colombian communities through
community-based telecommunications centers. The kiosks are publicly
accessible and installed primarily in schools, but also in homes,
community centers, pharmacies, and shops. The program targets schools as
installation sites so that the computers and services can be used for
educational purposes during school hours, and then opened to the
community at large at the end of the school day. In addition to the
Internet, users can access other services such as telephones, scanners,
printers, and photocopiers.

The program offers various levels of training services that educate
users about how to use these technologies, and most users only use the
trainings offered for basic Internet and computing access.

Each Internet access point costs US\$ 87,000 per year to operate. A
kiosk costs US\$ 20,000 up front to install, and the remainder is the
annual operating cost. Each kiosk is equipped with a telephone, a
television, a copy machine, between two and five computers, and both
broadband (4 Mbps) and Wi-Fi Internet. Users pay a nominal fee of 200
pesos (US\$ 0.07) per hour for use of the service. The cost is set
deliberately low and is not a meaningful source of revenue, but rather
is intended to symbolically habituate users to paying an ISP.

Progress and Results {#progress-and-results .ListParagraph}
====================

Although the project has been operational since 2001, its development
proceeds in four-year planning increments. It is currently operating
under the Vive Digital Plan 2014-2018, which includes a three-phase
implementation strategy built into its design. In phase one, ICTs
already installed by KVD in a number of rural communities were
supplemented with training programs developed according to the interests
and needs of each region. Phase one ended at the beginning of 2016.
During phase two, an additional 5,524 kiosks were installed in schools
for educational and community use, with the specific aim of enabling
communities to use and access other government services that are
Internet-dependent. In phase three, an additional 1,231 kiosks were
installed. As part of the National High-Speed Connectivity Project, 953
more kiosks will be installed in the Amazon, Orinoquía, and Chocóas
regions as well, where 130 of those have already been installed.

KVD trains approximately 20,000 people per year across all 7,000
locations. The initiative has been successful where installed because
Internet services are necessary to access many government services,
there are no competitors, and users like the service. The training
programs are also well attended, but mainly at the basic level. More
advanced and specialized training programs are less used. KVD uploads
user success stories to YouTube, and they maintain a digital map of
their service locations.

At present, KVD has installed and provides services to 7,000 locations
nationally. This is insufficient given that, of the 43,000 public
schools in Colombia, approximately 34,000 of them are rural schools
where kiosks could be installed, but there is not sufficient funding to
scale the project up to meet that need at this time.

Challenges {#challenges .ListParagraph}
==========

**Lack of power infrastructure --** Internet access requires
electricity, which most of the areas served do not have. KVD has been
implementing solar power alongside its kiosks in order to make them
functional, but this adds a burden to their operating and installation
costs. The installation of fiber-optic cables for telecommunications and
Internet takes a prohibitively long time and is urban-centric, which is
itself a challenge. As a consequence, they are reliant on satellite
technology to provide services, which is more expensive.

**Fluctuations in governmental support --** At both the local and
national level, the project experiences the challenge of government
support and resources being prioritized elsewhere. At the local level,
it can be difficult to establish the Internet as a priority among
leaders in communities that lack basic services and electricity because
it seems like a less pressing concern. But access to basic services
often depends on or is facilitated by having access to the Internet and
vice versa. At the national level, funding priorities change with
administrations. Financing is on a four-year cycle, so KVD has to
produce a new business plan every term, making long-term planning and
growth difficult. The universal services fund out of which government
sponsorship for KVD emerged also sponsors a variety of rural programs
(e.g., healthcare and educational initiatives) that are themselves
dependent on Internet service, which requires significant technical
support. There is some ambiguity about whose fiscal responsibility such
support is as well, which adds to the operating costs of the KVD
project.

**Long term planning made difficult --** The four-year cycle of
governmental administrations makes long-term planning difficult.
Ideally, the program would be operated with long-term initiatives that
are more apace with the protracted timescale of infrastructural
development. Presently, however, they can only count on being able to
complete initiatives that can be resolved before a new set of budgetary
priorities cycles in. Only 7,000 of Colombia's 34,000 rural schools are
served by KVD because there is not a sufficient or reliable budget to
sustain more.

KVD's Suggestions for Future Projects {#kvds-suggestions-for-future-projects .ListParagraph}
=====================================

**Innovative alternatives in rural infrastructure exist and should be
capitalized upon** -- Fiber optics can take years and even decades to
install in urban environments, and longer still in rural ones with less
robust infrastructure. There is a need for alternative means to provide
Internet services in the meantime so that remote communities are served.
Satellite is one way, but it is expensive.

**Community engagement and government support are essential --** Local
governmental and community support for the project are vital to its
success. Local leaders build communities of skills-sharing around the
training, enabling users to teach each other how to utilize the
services.

**Accenting for timing and planning cycles is necessary --** Planning
time is crucial. Initiatives are most effective when matched to the time
cycles of the governmental agencies that are dictating budgets and
funding allocations, even though ideally they would be able to plan with
a larger vision.
