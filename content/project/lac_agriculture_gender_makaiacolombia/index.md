Executive Summary  {#executive-summary .ListParagraph}
==================

Makaia is a nonprofit organization that has been using technology to
advance projects for social development since 2006. Founded by
Colombians Catalina Escobar, Camilo Mondragón, and Maria Claudia
Camacho, MAKAIA draws its name from one of the region's indigenous
languages. In Miskito, "makaia" means both "to do*"* and "to build."
This active ethos and social awareness inform Makaia's mission to create
innovative local development projects at the institutional, social, and
economic levels. Along with this mission, Makaia focuses on improvement
of digital skills and technology adoption of various communities,
including teachers and coffee growers, through digital literacy
programs.

Context {#context .ListParagraph}
=======

Colombia seeks to utilize information and communication technologies
(ICTs) to promote a knowledge society and modernize the country. The
National ICT Plan 2008-2019 proposed a set of policies, actions, and
projects to bring about efficient and productive use of ICTs among all
Colombians, with the aim to improve social inclusion and increase
competitiveness.

Due to the lack of competition, both fixed-line and mobile Internet
services in Colombia are among the most expensive compared to other
Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries.
Meanwhile, the average Internet speed in Colombia in 2013 was only 3
megabits per second (Mbps), according to the OECD. Additionally, the
connectivity inequity that exists is severe between urban and rural
areas. This is largely because most Colombians live in the cities where
the country's major Internet service providers (ISPs) hold significant
market power, yet are not interested in expanding the network to rural
areas. These issues combined with gender inequalities further
discriminate women to access the Internet.

The Ministry of Education has launched several initiatives to address
the digital literacy issue, including a pilot project to train teachers,
students, and parents with 1,500 donated Intel computers in 2007, or a
project called "Path of ICTs Appropriation" aiming at teachers'
professional development beginning 2008. Through the 899 Puntos Vive
Digital (community Internet centers), 100,771 people have received
digital literacy training.

Project Description {#project-description .ListParagraph}
===================

MAKAIA currently hosts a number of different programs in different
stages of development -- some continuing sustainably (e.g., ICT in
education); some successfully completed (e.g., access in libraries);
some in the planning and assessment stages (e.g., disability and access,
and digital security and ethics for schoolchildren); and some in their
initial implementation phase (e.g., digital literacy for coffee
growers). Below are some highlighted projects:

**Education --** MAKAIA provides a yearlong training program to teachers
at the middle and high school levels. Their intervention consists of
working with teachers to strengthen their capacity to incorporate ICTs
in education. These efforts are not limited to classroom pedagogy -- the
72-hour training program also seeks to support teachers in better
harnessing the value of technology in their own lives and for their own
professional development.

**Agriculture --** MAKAIA provides digital literacy training to coffee
growers, focusing their efforts in one of the former epicenters of the
conflict in Colombia. Ensuring not only training in digital competency
but also high-quality connectivity, the organization helps provide
farmers with technological solutions to agricultural problems.

Progress and Results {#progress-and-results .ListParagraph}
====================

More than 1,200 teachers in 60 schools across Colombia have been trained
in the effective use of technology in the classroom. Results and effect
assessments show that the program has improved educational outcomes and
engagement of students, while anecdotal feedback from teachers measures
the overwhelmingly positive impact that ICTs have on the quality of
education.

After completing a needs assessment in the area, MAKAIA discovered that
their training program would need to take a temporary backseat to
connectivity problems. They provided TV white space connectivity and
began offering their program for coffee growers in rural Colombia in
early 2017. The training in digital literacy and access for farmers has
so far educated thirty coffee growers in the use of mobile technology to
strengthen their agricultural practices.

Challenges {#challenges .ListParagraph}
==========

**Lack of Internet access --** MAKAIA's work highlights the problematic
public-sector tendency to overstate connectivity in developing nations.
While national leadership may wish to claim a higher position in
e-government ratings, this overstatement of usable Internet access can
be a stumbling block for development projects that seek to realistically
identify resources and needs.

**Funding --** Funding for ICT development can be difficult to advocate
for successfully in developing areas where more fundamental issues tend
to be prioritized (i.e., housing, nutrition, security, etc.).

**Physical safety --** While MAKAIA is committed to providing
connectivity and training to rural residents who are digitally
underserved, political instability can preempt implementation in certain
regions where the organization cannot ensure the safety of its staff.

MAKAIA's Suggestions for Future Projects {#makaias-suggestions-for-future-projects .ListParagraph}
========================================

**Needs assessment should preempt technology roll-out --** Their
experience demonstrates how it is essential that the project begin with
a development needs assessment. While MAKAIA focuses on technological
solutions, they stress that development needs must come before
technology needs.

**Flexibility of funders helps with the development process --** MAKAIA
notes the importance of flexibility from their funders. Often, the exact
needs of the people each project serves are not identified until after
the budget and timelines have been populated. Donors who recognize the
unique planning needs of social development work are also the most
effective.

**Technology should be considered as a means rather than an end --**
MAKAIA fundamentally disagrees with the concept of teaching about ICTs
and widely distributing devices without training. They insist that
technology is a means rather than an end. They emphasize that ICTs are
an invaluable tool, but only when it is directed toward thoughtfully
identified needs and goals. This challenge to the
laptop-and-tablet-distribution ethos prioritizes successful adoption and
problem-solving power over device saturation.
