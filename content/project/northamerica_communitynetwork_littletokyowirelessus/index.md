Executive Summary 
==================

Little Tokyo Unplugged was a community project by the Little Tokyo
Service Center (LTSC) that provided Wi-Fi Internet access to Little
Tokyo in Los Angeles, California and helped connect people to a
community website. Little Tokyo Unplugged sought to contribute to the
overall community development, and promote and preserve the Little Tokyo
community's culture and heritage. The project, which was funded by
various organizations, provided additional services to visitors and
supported small businesses to help bridge the digital divide in the
community. Despite the massive initial financial support, the project
failed to scale with the increasing demand, and could not create a
sustainable revenue model.

Context
=======

Mesh networks by communities around the United States seek to provide
alternatives to Internet service providers (ISPs) and connect
unconnected neighborhoods. Areas with limited or no Internet access tend
to be economically deprived, that lead to exacerbated inequalities.
Regulators and policy-makers in the U.S. are keen to expand the reach of
the Internet, recognizing its potential in developing communities.
Community mesh networks, at times, can be low-cost to deploy, and the
peer-to-peer model of connectivity seeks to foster community engagement
and participation in network growth. Such projects have cr

Project Description
===================

Little Tokyo Unplugged was a community project established in 2008 to
provide Wi-Fi Internet access to the Little Tokyo neighborhood in Los
Angeles, California. Little Tokyo Unplugged aimed to accomplish multiple
goals -- bridge the digital divide, as well as to contribute to the
neighborhood's overall economic and community development. When the
project was launched, the Little Tokyo community had 5,800 residents,
was relatively poorer than Los Angeles, and had no cable companies that
offered broadband connectivity. Many residents could not afford the
existing digital subscriber line (DSL) service. The L.A. Department of
Water and Power gave the LTSC access to some of its dark fiber, which
provided high-speed backhaul. The L.A. Community Redevelopment Agency
received a subsidized commercial ISP status. The California Emerging
Technology Fund awarded LTSC a grant of US\$ 250,000, which was
instrumental in bringing broadband to the community. The California
Emerging Technology Fund aimed to improve home broadband adoption, help
community residents secure jobs in technology related fields, and
integrate broadband use into routine activities such as banking.

The project also sought to provide education regarding the use of
Internet by training small businesses and youth. These trainings and
workshops were provided in English, Japanese, Spanish, and Korean. Youth
also received IT training.

LSTC also sought to preserve Little Tokyo's cultural heritage. Little
After logging in, users were directed to a splash webpage that included
information about events and activities impacting the Little Tokyo
Community. LSTC included local users in content creation to increase
community participation, and broadcast live cultural events to attract
tourists and cause them to develop deeper appreciation for the
communities' history and culture.

Progress and Results
====================

Little Tokyo Unplugged lasted for two years, and connected more than 300
residents over a wireless network. Twelve wireless networks were built
with the grant money through the project, which reached 2,479 housing
units out of which 321 households took steps to connect to the network.
Free mesh networks served as the primary Internet connection for
businesses and nonprofits in Little Tokyo. The project ended up focusing
solely on providing Internet, but as the number of users grew, the
network could not scale with its initially generous but also limited
funding. The project did manage to secure some revenue, however, by
leasing their network to the L.A. Police for the city's security network
and cameras.

Through this project, LSTC trained youth on the use of computers and
various workshops were conducted to educate the community about the same
topic. Small business owners created their websites using the network
and platform. LTSC soon realized, though, that training youth was time
consuming, and required more staff and planning. With time, these
efforts were scaled back significantly.

The L.A. community redevelopment authority discontinued providing
resources after the California legislature moved to dissolve
redevelopment authorities statewide. The project thus could not hire
staff to scale the network. An increase in the number of smartphones
connected to the network also caused exceedances in capacity. Network
users overwhelmed LTSC staff with complaints on dropped connections and
network security. LSTC faced challenges with engaging the community to
maintain the network, and along with other factors, this led to its
demise after two years of existence.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of community participation** -- LTSC ended up operating like a
traditional service provider with no community interest. The network
failed to include the users in content creation, and the project failed
to create a sense of community ownership in the network. Since there was
no grassroots support from the community, the project only relied on
grants and funding. These funds were exhausted a year into the project.

**Lack of expertise** -- The project had a strong record of providing
high-quality services for low-income seniors, families, youth, and
children. These demographics did not have expertise on community
networks or how ISPs work. There was a lack of planning, and the project
could not anticipate growing demand or other network problems.

**Lack of clear sustainable business model** -- The project failed to
become sustainable, as there were no revenue sources. The network
survived solely on funding from organizations. Since funding was easily
available, the project did not focus on its financial sustainability.
This affected the project when it became difficult to secure funding.

**Inability to cope with scale** -- The increase in the number of users,
especially smartphone users, coupled with limited technical expertise
and funding, made it impossible for the network to cope with scale.
Network users overwhelmed the staff with complaints, and eventually the
staff was not able to cope with the workload. The project could not hire
additional staff, and ended up devoting substantial time to customer
service rather than building a reliable and sustainable network.

LTSC's Suggestions for Future Projects
======================================

**Commons based approaches requires active community participation and
governance --** According to the Little Tokyo team, one of the most
critical aspects of a community mesh network is the involvement of the
users. The users need to be made stakeholders of the project, and are
critical to the development of infrastructure as well as content. Strong
social norms around community-based ownership may have helped sustain
the network.
