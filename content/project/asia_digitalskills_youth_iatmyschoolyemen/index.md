Executive Summary 
==================

Internet\@MySchool is an initiative by ISOC Yemen that seeks to set up
Internet access hotspots and provide training in ICT skills through
workshops and lectures to secondary school students, as well as by
commissioning training materials in the local language (Arabic) in four
schools in Sanaa and Aden in Yemen.

Context
=======

Yemen is among the countries with the lowest rates of internet
penetration in the Middle East region, with penetration only at 15
percent. The country also lacks access to 3G connectivity and has
suffered damage to key internet infrastructure owing to the ongoing
civil war.

Project Description
===================

Internet\@MySchool proposes a two-pronged approach: first, to connect
six schools to the internet through wireless hotspots, and second, to
train secondary school students through workshops, lectures, and
material in the local language. ISOC-Yemen has received a grant under
the Beyond the Net grants program for the deployment of
Internet\@MySchool in 2016-17. The project is identifying schools in
areas relatively shielded from the conflict to deploy wireless hotspots.

The chapter seeks to introduce an Arabic-language illustrative primer
for secondary school students who have never been exposed to the
Internet before. Multiple workshops, and guest lectures to train
students in information and communications technologies are being put
together, along with contests to engage the students and measure their
progress in adopting to the Internet. Their stories and experiences are
to be documented and disseminated to illustrate the transformative power
of the internet.

Progress and Results
====================

By the end of 2017, the project has trained 300 high school students
from four schools in two cities in Yemen. Two contests to engage with
youth, as well as multiple workshops and guest lectures are being put
together to create heightened awareness of the Internet in Yemen's next
generation.

Challenges
==========

**Stable infrastructure:** The ongoing conflict causes frequent power
outages and disrupts communications. Solar generators and alternative
sources of electricity are required to power devices that provide
Internet access.

**Low level of ICT skills training among youth:** Youth are not readily
exposed to training in information and communication technologies at the
school level in Yemen currently.

**Lack of availability of local language content for ICT training:**
Materials in Arabic for the purposes of educating the youth in ICT
skills are presently unavailable.

ISOC Yemen's Suggestions for Future Projects
============================================

**Local content development for ICT training shows promise as a unique
way to engage with Internet newcomers** \-- ICT skills training and
provisioning at schools provide the next generation with critical skills
to access and use the Internet for their benefit. This is especially
true when the training incorporates elements of local language and
culture, in contexts such as the middle east
