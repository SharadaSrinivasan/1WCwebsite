Executive Summary 
==================

The Southern California Tribal Digital Village (SCTDV) is administered
by the Southern California Tribal Chairmen's Association (SCTCA), a
nonprofit that has served 19 federally-recognized Southern Californian
Indian tribes since 1972. The Tribal Digital Village, and early
community network, was established in 2001 to bring Internet access to
Native American communities. The network, free to use for municipal
centers and priced on an affordable sliding scale for others, is
tribally operated and is located entirely on tribal lands. Since the
network's inception in 2001, high school graduation has become radically
more attainable in these communities due to additional resources made
available via the Internet.

Context
=======

There are 567 federally recognized Indian Nations in the United States
that are ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse. About 229
of these nations are located in Alaska, while others are located in 35
other states. There are also state recognized tribes. A consortium of 19
federally recognized Native American tribes in Southern California
established the Southern California Tribal Chairmen\'s Association in
1972 with a goal of serving the needs of its tribal members and
descendants in the San Diego County urban areas. SCTCA implemented the
Tribal Digital Village program to address the need of Internet access
among its underserved member communities.

Connectivity is especially important for tribal communities to access
opportunities for growth, productivity, and innovation, as they are
generally located in remote areas. In 2012, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) reported that the lack of service hindered tribal
nations from building their internal structures for self-governance,
economic opportunity, education, public safety, and cultural
preservation. In 2016, the FCC reported that 41 percent of U.S. citizens
living on tribal lands, and 68 percent of those in the rural areas of
tribal lands, lacked access to broadband. Location, population density,
and poverty are the main barriers for Native Americans to be connected.

From 2010 to 2014, the federal government provided more than US\$ 33
billion to promote greater access and adoption of high-speed Internet in
underserved areas, including tribal lands, through the FCC's Universal
Service Fund and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities
Service. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found that these two
agencies did not make efficient use of federal resources, however. Many
tribes and advocacy groups are handling the matter themselves, such as
operating telecommunications companies offering broadband service,
building infrastructure, and collecting data for tribal broadband
penetration and use.

Project Description
===================

The Southern California Tribal Digital Village operates as a high-speed
wireless microwave network, with some experimental forays in TV white
space (TVWS) and an eye toward incorporating fiber optics where
possible. They envision a hybrid network of wireless and fiber in order
to keep up with evolutions in technology and network capability.

The network serves a collection of tribal communities, and is focused on
social welfare and educational outcomes. By providing free Internet
access to libraries, schools, head start programs, and health and
community centers, SCDTV prioritizes the support and empowerment of its
users. By offering a paid service to private homes, SCDTV both assures
sustainable profitability and encourages the integration of all kinds of
digital tools and cultures into tribal communities.

The 19 tribes served by the SCTCA are the: Barona Band of Mission
Indians, Cahuilla Band of Mission Indians, Campo Band of Kumeyaay
Indians, Chemehuevi Indian Tribe, Ewiiaapaayp Band of Kumeyaay Indians,
Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel, La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians,
Inaja-Cosmit Band of Indians, Jamul Indian Village A Kumeyaay Nation,
Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupeño Indians, La Posta Band of
Mission Indians, Pauma Band of Luiseño Indians, Mesa Grande Band of
Mission Indians, Manzanita Band of the Kumeyaay Nation, San Pasqual Band
of Mission Indians, Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians, Pala Band of Mission
Indians, Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, and the Sycuan Band of the
Kumeyaay Nation.

Progress and Results
====================

In the 19 communities connected, there are upwards of 500 homes
currently connected. The network also incorporates libraries, schools,
head start programs, and municipal centers. The program is actively
growing; with a total of roughly 10,000 residents in the areas they
serve, they currently estimate their reach is between 1,500 and 2,000
users, and aim to expand access to an additional 1,000 people in the
near future.

Access to the Internet has been a dramatic factor in lowering high
school attrition rates in particular. Since 2001, high school graduation
has become radically more attainable in these communities due to
additional resources made available via the Internet. In communities
that often require consecutive missed school days for students to tend
to cultural and family responsibilities, after-school programs and
learning software such as Cyber High and PLATO have allowed students
unprecedented opportunities to stay abreast of their curricula. With
less students falling behind, more remain flexibly engaged with their
studies and graduate, empowering young people as well as strengthening
communities.

Challenges
==========

**Geographical barriers --** Much of the tribal land in this area is
limited to mountainous areas. Additionally, the borders of tribal lands
are discontinuous, often interrupted by county lands. These two factors
create infrastructural difficulties for network design and building. In
terms of network maintenance, the project is threatened by unstable
access to a power source. Fearing the expense of equipment damage from
high winds and fires, local power companies often cut power to these
communities, sometimes leaving them without a regular grid-based power
supply for days.

**Funding while sovereign --** In the U.S., federally recognized
indigenous tribes have a relationship of sovereign dependence to the
government. This status denotes a complex political status; whereas
sovereignty signifies self-governance and independence, 'dependence'
indicates tribes' subordination to federal regulations and laws. When
coupled with chronic governmental inattention to the needs and rights of
Native American tribes, this status can prove to be a stumbling block to
pursuing grant funding. For example, when the federal government
outsources funding decision to state governments, tribal eligibility is
threatened because "dependence" delimits tribes' political relationships
narrowly to the federal government. Certain instances of legislative
oversight and targeted exclusion have been successfully sidestepped by
helpful partnerships with private companies and public universities.

**Generation gap --** Tribal elders can prove resistant to the
introduction of technology, fearing it will threaten the preservation of
their communities, histories, and cultures. Additional outreach is
necessary to communicate the opportunities for preservation and
community-building that the Internet provides.

SCTCA's Suggestions for Future Projects
=======================================

**Early attention to sustainability --** The project began somewhat
shortsightedly, operating on a grant-to-grant basis before transitioning
to a sustainability-based business plan. The SCTDV team notes that
immediate emphasis on financial planning and long-term maintenance would
have better served their aims.

**Network-by-network planning --** Like many other successful network
builders, SCTDV highlights the importance of taking into account the
unique needs and goals of each individual network. It's key to begin
with a clear knowledge of each network's specific end goals and
outcomes, as well as throughout knowledge of both terrain as well as the
requirements and priorities of the community the network is meant to
serve.
