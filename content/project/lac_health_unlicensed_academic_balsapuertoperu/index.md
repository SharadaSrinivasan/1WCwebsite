Executive Summary 
==================

The Balsapuerto Network was constructed in 2012 in an effort to improve
healthcare in the upper Amazon through low-cost 3G wireless
connectivity. Four healthcare centers in the district were connected
with 5.8 gigahertz (GHz) point-to-point links: Balsapuerto, Varadero,
San Juan, and Yurimaguas. Led by Professors Alan Mickelson from the
University of Colorado Boulder and Martin Murillo from Notre Dame
University, the initiative yielded successful results and experiences
related to specific issues of infrastructure, technology, and
implementation in remote jungle regions. Too-late attention to network
sustainability stymied the project's potential, however.

Context
============

Balsapuerto is located in the heart of Amazonian Peru and is one of the
poorest regions in the world. Balsapuerto is the poorest district of the
poorest Peruvian province. The dense Amazon rainforest makes it very
difficult to build infrastructure, including roads. As a result, the
village is reachable only by boat from nearby Yurimaguas, which is the
nearest town with a hospital as well as telephone and Internet service.
Due to its extreme isolation and low population density (less than 10
people per square kilometer), major telecom operators do not serve the
area. As a country, Peru lags behind, both regionally and globally, when
it comes to fixed broadband subscriptions and mobile subscriptions. In
recent years, however, the country has boasted the fifth-fastest
Internet user growth worldwide -- only behind India, the Philippines,
Indonesia, and South Africa, according to eMarketer.

In 2011, the Peruvian government implemented a National Broadband Plan
that aims to provide Internet connectivity to remote regions of Peru.
The plan includes the construction of a national fiber optic backbone
network as well as connecting all municipalities and health and
education centers in rural zones. Even with this plan and the
government's telecommunications investment fund (FITEL), which promotes
service in isolated regions, however, barriers such as extensive poverty
and economic inequality, expensive service, little competition, and a
harsh landscape of mountains and jungles has resulted in slow,
expensive, and inaccessible broadband Internet access.

Project Description
===================

The Balsapuerto network was built in 2012 as a collaborative project
between the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),
the Grupo de Telecommunicaciones Rurales (an affiliate of the Catholic
University of Lima), and a collection of expert volunteers. The network
connects four health posts in the upper Amazon using low-cost,
high-speed Internet connectivity with Wi-Fi Long Distance Networking
(WiLDNet). The technological aspects of the network were very
successful, but the project suffered from little-to-no planning for the
network's financial sustainability. The network as it was originally
conceived ceased to function in mid-2014 and was rebuilt and re-oriented
by international research funding that stripped the local stakeholders
of ownership and did little to improve the long-term prospects for
sustainability.

Progress and Results
====================

In 2014, the program managers wrote a Humanitarian Activities Committee
grant to organize a workshop focused on sustainability. Participants
included the network's local stakeholders and invited experts in
information technology and developmental economics. The two-day meeting
resulted in agreements that would produce a for-profit business model
able to sustain the network's maintenance in all the concerned villages.
However, these agreements were never put into action. The networks were
taken over and re-equipped by the European Union under a research aegis,
and slipped out of the ownership and purview of the original research
team.

The network continues to support health post connectivity, improving the
efficacy of record keeping and care in the area, though there is little
available data on exactly how its improvements have been impactful or
how long the network will be maintained. The project's instigators are
currently at work building a similar network in Bolivia using the
lessons learned from their experiences in Balsapeurto.

Challenges
==========

**Uneven terrain --** This upper Amazon district is difficult to access.
Roads are underdeveloped and the river tributary that leads to the local
port is often dry, making the area doubly inaccessible.

**Lack of a business model --** Though a sustainable model was
eventually developed, it could not be implemented because it was
developed after the network had already exhausted its resources, which
were only intended for the network's creation.

**Regulatory Ambiguity --** Certain rhetorical choices on the part of
the project managers made their regulatory position ambiguous. Because
of some grey areas in the status of voice of Internet Protocol (VoIP),
the telecommunications sector was also concerned that connectivity might
be infringing on phone service competition without the proper licensing.

**Lack of social integration and encouragement --** Once the network was
taken over by international funding sources, the funding agents
instituted a healthcare-only mindset for the network's use. With
amplification, the WiLDNet technology could easily support many users
pursuing a variety of online activities, but this was needlessly
discouraged.

Balsapuerto Network's Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================================

**Local maintenance support can help maintain network resources --** The
project team notes that costs were reduced and network capabilities
improved by training local community members in the maintenance and
protection of the network infrastructure. Local trainees can assist by
handling basic functional tasks: lightning rod construction and battery
replacement, microgrid maintenance, etc.

**Local ownership and planning might help sustainability --** The
project team notes that local network ownership is beneficial to
sustainable networks. Originally, the health centers and local
stakeholders privately owned the network. After the transition to
internationally based research funds, the infrastructure was replaced
and ownership reverted to the State, as is common when funding is
sourced from global charitable organizations. The project team notes
that State ownership backed by charitable/research funding can be
detrimental to such projects. With the right development plan, a network
of this type can be sustainable. The key is to consider sustainability
from the outset. Even in areas as low-income as the upper Amazon, there
are still opportunities for generating profit and maintaining long-term
sustainability.

**Publication for knowledge-sharing is key --** The network's initiators
noted the need for researchers to publish the work they are conducting
in the region. While there is a great deal of relevant research relating
to jungle network construction being conducted, its high rate of failure
is preventing publicity that could be helpful to future projects.
