Executive Summary 
==================

Siyafunda CTC brings connectivity, technology, and digital literacy to
underserviced, generally rural, communities in South Africa. By engaging
the government, corporations, and local nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), Siyafunda CTC successfully constructed approximately 180
community knowledge centers (CKCs) in rural villages and schools across
the country. These CKCs provide access to the Internet as well as offer
low-cost basic and advanced digital literacy training. Siyafunda CTC is
an example of a multistakeholder implementation model to produce
sustainable connected community centers for traditionally underserviced
areas.

Context
============

In South Africa, a majority of households use cellular data to connect
to the Internet. The ratio of cellular telephone subscriptions to people
is 1.5 to 1. South Africa has focused on information and communications
technology (ICT) development in Johannesburg which has competitive
prepaid rates, but broadband in the county as a whole remains expensive
compared to other developing nations. Broadband subscription penetration
is low, at 5.3 subscriptions per 100 people, and speeds are not
commensurate with cost.

With an eye toward developing better broadband infrastructure, the
government's "South Africa Connect" project has set two target goals: 90
percent of the South African population should receive internet at 5
megabits per second (Mbps) and 50 percent of the country's population
should connect at average speeds of almost 100 Mbps. While
municipalities have plans to install public Wi-Fi hotspots, this
deployment does not aid those in rural areas.

Project Description
===================

Siyafunda CTC launched in November 2006 with an aim to "empower,
educate, and econnect communities" guided by the core values of access,
affordability, and sustainability. Through the construction of knowledge
centers in standalone settings and at schools, Siyafunda offers
e-Learning and affordable ICT accredited courses and skills training.
Through a blend of peer-, self-, and expert-taught courses, CKCs provide
comprehensive digital literacy training. Courses are provided at minimal
cost to users, and the average length is approximately a month.
Community members not enrolled in courses are also able to use the
computers at a low-cost. Funds raised from these fees are reincorporated
into the CKC so that it can sustain itself.

The CKCs also provide other services. These include business and
entrepreneurial skills development and training, adult literacy
programs, bulk Short Message Service (SMS) facilities for community
information dissemination, résumé preparation help, and website design
and hosting. Siyafunda CTC uses a model the organization refers to as
"community public private participation" (CPPP). In practice, this
involves leveraging and exploiting as many connections as possible to
implement the organization's goals. Siyafunda CTC partners with all
levels of government, universities, NGOs, and corporations seeking
donation opportunities.

Progress and Results
====================

The Siyafunda project has scaled from a single pilot location to more
than 180 by 2017. In addition, the organization often implements pilot
training programs throughout their network of CKCs. For example,
Siyafunda is currently helping to orchestrate a pilot program for 3-D
Virtual Learning Environment (3DVLE) in nine schools.

Although the overall number of constituents serviced by the CKCs is
unknown, available data paint an optimistic picture. For example,
centers in all provinces are responsible for more than 3,000 basic
literacy training and 52 advanced Cisco trainings. They have set up
nearly 3,500 individuals with email accounts, and 28 people make use of
the facilities per day on average. The demographics of the constituency
range from school-aged children and youth (ages 18-35) to the elderly.
Siyafunda works with partners to ensure that disabled individuals and
the visually impaired have access to the CKCs. Notably, 70 percent of
Siyafunda CKC users are reported to be female.

Since youth unemployment is almost 30 percent in South Africa, Siyafunda
works with students from third and fourth grade all the way to early
adulthood to help them use the Internet to learn of employment
opportunities and develop their digital skills. The CKCs provide résumé
building assistance. Siyafunda CTC also runs government-accredited
courses to improve youth employability.

Professional development training at CKCs includes entrepreneurship
training. Many constituents run informal businesses and the CKCs help
these individuals augment their businesses through online marketing and
expansion of potential customer bases. The CKCs are also a hub for two
related entrepreneurial programs: Intel's She Will Connect program that
focuses on building the digital skills of women and girls since 2014 and
training 10,000 women/girls per quarter on average, and SAP ACW --
Africa Code Week that focuses on a coding program, now in its third year
in 2017.

Finally, Siyafunda aims to provide useful connectivity to constituents.
At a recent women's training, 30 of the women were agricultural workers.
Course leaders taught the women computer skills that have utility to
their lives, as opposed to more traditional computing skills such as how
to create a spreadsheet.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding** -- Since many of the locations where
Siyafunda CTC provides resources rely on grants, outside funding cannot
be always be guaranteed. Though Siyafunda CTC has been able to generally
subsidize the cost of data to charge minimal fees to constituents,
overall data fees in Africa keep broadband-enabled technologies out of
the hands of disadvantaged citizens.

**Lack of skilled manpower --** In most instances, Siyafunda CTC
provides resources to local NGO partners to implement their coursework.
The skill-level of each facilitator and their ability to teach digital
literacy varies drastically, proving to be a challenge to consistent
delivery of courses.

**Lack of locally relevant and local language content --** Most
trainings are in English, and work best for users who have dual-fluency
in their local vernacular and English.

**Coordination challenges** **--** There is a gap between national and
local government interaction, and this may impede the efficient and
successful implementation of policy.

Siyafunda CTC's Suggestions for Future Projects
===============================================

**Engaging effective multi-stakeholder collaborations is helpful --**
Siyafunda CTC notes that its ability to build connections between
stakeholders, including the tripartite levels of government,
corporations, and NGOs is of immense value. Previous attempts to bring
connectivity to underserviced areas were not orchestrated in concert and
were implemented unevenly and inefficiently. The lack of a centralized
plan where stakeholders worked simultaneously led to a considerable
amount of redundancy. By incorporating all interested parties into
deployment of a project, resources can be distributed equitably and in
the most efficient manner possible.

**Connecting vulnerable demographics within the unconnected is of
importance --**. Siyafunda CTC actively trains women in its CKCs. The
cultural positioning of women in South African society makes them
important adopters of technology and leads to more effective community
adoption. Siyafunda CTC's focus on disabled individuals is also
important as this constituency is sometimes forgotten even in the most
well-meaning endeavors.
