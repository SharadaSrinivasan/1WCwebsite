Executive Summary 
==================

The Rural Communications Project in Papua New Guinea aims to facilitate
improved access to affordable and reliable telecommunications in rural
and remote areas. Launched in 2009, the project seeks to provide
broadband internet access in rural district centers without any internet
service, reaching nearly 500,000 rural Papua New Guineans by 2017.

Context
=======

In 2009, only 20 percent of Papua New Guineans had access to cellular
coverage, with a majority of the 80 percent that live in rural areas
having no access of any kind. High prices and limited investment in
access networks kept service delivery quite low. Total teledensity was
just 4 percent countrywide. Since the privatization of this market in
2007 with the entry of Digicel and GreenCom, the country has seen some
gains in coverage and access. While service providers have embarked on a
network rollout for more citizens, many remote areas remained unserved
or underserved.

Project Description
===================

The Rural Communications Project was envisaged to provide Internet
connectivity for rural and remote areas. Financed by the World Bank and
managed by the National ICT Authority of Papua New Guinea, the Rural
Communications Project has deployed mobile base stations in 59 sites in
remote areas in all four regions of the country, providing basic telecom
services to about 500,000 Papua New Guineans. A one-time subsidy has
been provided to the telecom operator Digicel in order to set up these
stations.

The project also technical assistance to the National Information and
Communications Technology Authority (NICTA) to address emerging
regulatory challenges and to strengthen the competitiveness of the
telecommunications market. The World Bank also coordinates with the
Department of Communication and Information (DCI) to enable ICT policy
development and establish a universal access and service (UAS).

The stations are often coupled with solar-powered charging stations to
allow people to charge their cell phones in areas with minimal
electricity.

Progress and Results
====================

The World Bank has invested a total of US$ 15 million in this project
since 2009. Combined with existing investments by mobile operators, the
project is expected to boost total population coverage to over 90
percent by the end of 2015.

The benefits of rural connectivity are felt acutely in villages like
Kore, which previously had no access to any form of telecommunications
services. Initially, villagers had to climb up a hill to receive weak
mobile signals from a cell phone tower in Hula 25 kilometers away. The
establishment of a base station in Kore allows farmers to order seeds
and fertilizers using a cell phone instead of spending the extended time
needed to travel to Port Moresby. Women entrepreneurs have started
selling prepaid top-up cards to the villagers and set up solar-based
charging stations for mobile phones. Access to services enhances
economic opportunities for these communities.

One of the significant advances has been in emergency service delivery.
Mobile phone services allow for people in unconnected areas to reach
medical assistance far quicker, saving many lives.

By August 2017, the project aims to contribute to many social and
economic development objectives of the country. Local businesses are
expected to experience lower communications costs and improved access to
information about markets and prices as well as ICT-enabled
entrepreneurship, and new services such as e-commerce platforms and
Internet cafes.

Challenges
==========

**Challenging terrain -** Access levels in Papua New Guinea are among the
lowest in the world, with fixed broadband penetration still below 1
percent and overall Internet penetration at around 20 percent of the
population in 2009. The terrain makes deployment of traditional
infrastructure over vast swatches of the country very difficult.

**High cost of backhaul-** Connectivity in the islands
of Papua New Guinea is well outside the range of small businesses and
individuals, both due to capacity constraints on fiber availability as
well the lack of high-capacity domestic backbone networks.

Rural Communications Project PNG's Suggestions for Future Projects
=====================================

**Traditional telecommunications infrastructure can transform rural
lives** -- Telecommunications can provide people access to economic
opportunities in a country like Papua New Guinea and reduce transaction
costs for low-income families to carry out activities for their daily
subsistence.

**Connectivity gains through installation of cell towers can be
cost effective -** In Papua New Guinea, connectivity rose from 20
percent to nearly 90 percent in six years for an investment of US$ 15
million. Women are better able to reap the benefits of connectivity,
through access to entrepreneurship opportunities in the digital economy.
