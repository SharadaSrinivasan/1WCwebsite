Executive Summary 
==================

A 2013 grant- and donor-based initiative brought connectivity, training,
and information and communications technology (ICT) equipment to the
Nyirarukobwa Primary School in the Bugasera district of Rwanda, an
underprivileged area on the outskirts of Kigali. The school responded
well to connectivity, radically increasing its ranking, test scores, and
enrollment. Nyirarukobwa was meant to serve as a pilot program for a
more expansive connectivity project, but it hit roadblocks in terms of
support and long-term maintenance. Despite the success of the program's
initial stages, it is struggling with issues of sustainable financing.

Context
=======

Technology and ICT skills were identified as the critical factors to
improve human resources for Rwanda's knowledge-based economy in VISION
2020, the country's development framework. The plan aims to provide
Internet access in all secondary schools and the majority of primary
schools across Rwanda by 2020. According to Rwanda Education Board
(REB), 531 schools, which accounts for 9 percent of the total schools in
Rwanda, have access to the Internet. In 2017, the Rwandan government
partnered with Microsoft to launch a three-year project that aims to
deploy ICT infrastructure for the country, with the goal of providing
Internet access to more than 3 million students and 61,000 teachers in
3,500 schools. They also launched smart classrooms, which feature
projectors, laptops, and Internet access.

The private sector also took initiative, such as Samsung Electronics
East Africa by launching solar-powered Internet schools in Bugesera
District in 2014. In addition, Rwanda claimed the fastest growing One
Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project adoption in Africa, which was piloted in
2007 by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-based nonprofit
that provides rugged, low-cost personal computers to disadvantaged
children in Latin America and Africa. Currently, 280,313 Rwandan
children in 500 participating schools have access to a computer. The
program also organized professional development workshops for teachers
and seminars on the creative uses of laptops. While these initiatives
have brought some key benefits to the Rwandan education system, the lack
of adequate infrastructure and expertise still hinders the effectiveness
of Rwanda's efforts to improve its connectivity at schools.

Project Description
===================

Bringing connectivity to the Nyirarukobwa Primary School began as an
initiative of the Rwanda Chapter of the Internet Society (ISOC). With a
grant of \$10,000 from ISOC, the school was able to purchase five
computers and all the materials necessary to set up a small computer
lab. This grant was also inclusive of incentives for local ISOC members
to run a thorough training program in digital literacy and computer
skills.

The training consisted of two modules; the first explored concepts of
information and communications technology, which consisted of
explanatory lessons on hardware, software, networks, security, and law,
as well as basic aspects of everyday computing: emails, blogs, online
communities, ergonomic postures, health, etc.). The second focused on
using the computer and managing files, which provided more detailed
instruction on effective individual and group computer usage and storage
practices. Supplementary trainings were provided to a teacher who
assumed the responsibility for ICT maintenance in order to avoid the
expense of outsourcing labor.

In addition, Airtel donated two full years of Internet connectivity to
the school, along with free phones for teachers to communicate with each
other, and vital infrastructural improvements to the school itself: roof
repairs, new desks, and new window panes. OLPC also donated 25 units to
the school. With the learning environment fortified by adequate digital
tools, teachers were prepared to introduce ICT and Internet learning
into their classrooms for the first time.

Progress and Results
====================

The impact of the initiative has been unequivocally positive. More
students than ever are continuing on to secondary school. Nyirarukobwa
Primary School, previously the lowest ranked primary school in its
district, is currently the highest ranked. And improvements to the
school's buildings are better protecting students and teachers from the
region's severe climates, which had been interfering with the children's
ability to learn.

With the aid of the school's new printers, teachers are able to quickly
generate individual worksheets that children can use to learn and
progress academically. Before the ICT equipment made this possible,
teachers had only the resources of the common blackboard, handwritten
materials, and large-scale repetition methods. The lack of ICT equipment
makes it difficult to provide individual attention to students who may
need it.

By introducing these students to the Internet at the primary school
level, the project is giving them the opportunity to develop early
fluency in digital literacy. Students are instructed in Internet
research skills and encouraged to indulge their curiosity to become
self-motivated knowledge seekers. The computers are used both in class
and out too: the school provides after-school, break-time, and weekend
hours for students to spend time on the Internet.

The Rwandan Ministry of Education requires students to pass its national
exam in order to continue from primary to secondary school. Before
gaining connectivity, it was not uncommon for zero students at the
Nyirarukobwa to pass. In good years, one or two students might succeed.
After connectivity, 10-to-20 students are passing the exam each year and
continuing their education. Because of the school's heightened ranking,
test scores, and advanced equipment, enrollment has doubled and
attendance is regular. At the time the project was started, the school
had 720 students; currently, it enrolls 1,415.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding --** The initial ISOC grant of US\$ 10,000
was enough to purchase equipment and provide training, while the Airtel
donation brought two years of uninterrupted connectivity to the school
and OLPC provided hardware but not connectivity. As of 2017, however,
the school does not have a reliable income source to sustain
connectivity into the future. Teachers are using personal funds to
purchase Internet access in daily or weekly packages.

**Limited physical infrastructure --** While increased enrollment and
participation are salutary educational developments, the resultant
school overcrowding and increased class sizes are not. The school has
split its school day into alternating morning and afternoon sessions to
accommodate the larger student population and hired five additional
teachers (18 total), but capacity remains a challenge.

Nyirarukobwa Primary School's Suggestions for Future Projects
=============================================================

**Training of ICT teachers is required for improved outcomes --** The
project credits its early emphasis on an organized and comprehensive
training program for its learning outcomes. The project notes that
training and available sources for follow-up education are vital for the
efficacious use of connectivity in the classroom.

**A comfortable and safe learning environment aids connectivity-related
outcomes --** Training is not the only necessary supplement to the
introduction of connectivity and computers. This case demonstrates
sensitivity and awareness of the educational impact of safe and
comfortable learning environments. If students are distracted, cold, or
ill at ease in their surroundings, they are less likely to learn well.

**Planning for sustainability should be incorporated at the initial
stages of design --** The expansion phase and long-term maintenance
plans were not included from the beginning stages of the project. This
has resulted in an uncertain future for the school. The project team
emphasizes the value of those planning connectivity projects to focus
their planning as much on the initial implementation as on future
sustainability -- regular funding sources, subsidies, equipment
maintenance and upgrades.
