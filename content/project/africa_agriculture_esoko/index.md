Executive Summary 
==================

Esoko launched in 2005 and seeks to capitalize on increased mobile phone
uptake across Africa to use information and communications technologies
(ICTs) to help farmers improve their incomes. They started by sending
voice and text messages to small farmers containing information on
agribusiness, including weather and pricing, and linking farmers to
buyers. They are now expanding the project to establish digital
footprints within rural communities throughout Africa. They collect data
from these communities (biometrics, GPS, and mobile money data) to form
a database that can be used in a targeted way to connect users to
specific services of interest (e.g., healthcare, business, e-governance,
e-commerce, etc.). The project serves small farmers and rural
communities in Ghana, Tanzania, Malawi, Burkina Faso as well as in
Mexico.

Context
=======

Statistics from the United States' Global Hunger and Food Security
Initiative estimated that agriculture accounted for almost 30 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in East African countries. It employs more
than 60 percent of the region's population, with staple food dominating
the total traded agriculture products (75 percent). Although traditional
agricultural practices passed down through generations are still
prevalent, farming technologies developed by locals are also on the
rise, providing effective solutions to smallholders. Increased phone use
in East Africa has facilitated technology to expand its impact on
agricultural practices.

Both the public and the private sectors in East Africa are spearheading
the efforts to transform the agriculture sector. Kilimo Salama, a
microinsurance company, has been providing a completely automated,
"pay-as-you-plan"-type of insurance that protects farmers against bad
weather. The World Cocoa Foundation created the app CocoaLink to provide
free voice and text messages in English and local languages about farm
safety, child labor, tips for farming practices, and crop marketing for
Ghanaian farmers. In 2017, MasterCard launched a new digital marketplace
for East African farmers to sell their crops and receive payments via
their mobile phones called 2Kuze.

Project Description
===================

Esoko started in 2005 as an experiment to see how the emergence of
mobile technology in Africa could improve the lives of rural communities
across the continent. The first project enabled the delivery of market
prices via Short Message Service (SMS), in support of work that FoodNet
was doing with the telecommunications operator MTN in Uganda. In
addition, Esoko set up a call center to support local languages and
address issues with literacy. Over time, they realized farmers needed
much more than price information, and added weather alerts, crop advice,
and linked buyers with sellers. The company then leveraged its technical
platform and field force for the collection of information, mostly using
tablet devices and smartphones. This technology, Insyt, became the
backbone of many large scale social protection programs in Ghana --
helping agencies convert from paper, thus reducing cost, time and
errors, in targeting beneficiaries. In 2016, Esoko incubated and
spun-off Tulaa into a sperate company, a virtual marketplace, which
provides smallholders with access to inputs and finance. As a growing
social business, Esoko reinvests the majority of its returns into the
business, to scale quickly, and maximize its impact on rural
communities. Esoko is committed to improving income for rural
communities by empowering them, and the businesses that serve them,
through mobile technology. The project is deployed primarily in Ghana
and Tanzania, with resellers in Malawi, Burkina Faso and Mexico. Users
are rural populations and smallholder farmers.

Under the Vodafone Farmers Club VFC of Ghana, market prices and farmer
information costs a small fee, which is paid via mobile phone credit,
and typically runs approximately 2 cedis (US\$ 0.50) per month for
weather and market information as well as agricultural tips. Outside the
VFC program, market price alerts cost US\$ 10 per month, with weather
and agric tips costing US\$ 0.04 and US\$ 0.02 per alert, respectively.
This cost is usually taken up by development projects looking to help
smallholder farmers.

Esoko sends field agents to project beneficiaries and sites of interest
for one day at a time in order to conduct trainings. They train in basic
ICT literacy, including how to use the basics of the mobile phone, such
as checking messages, as well as more sophisticated use of apps. When
they profile farmers, they also record the preferred languages for each
user so when the user calls the call center, they are automatically
re-directed to a speaker of their native language. The call center will
translate text messages to voice memos and also translate between
languages. They train them at a basic level to simply identify messages
from the service so that they can then call in for more specialized
assistance if needed.

Progress and Results
====================

Since its inception, the project has expanded its mission considerably.
Initially devised to serve smallholder farmers in rural Africa, the
project now reaches rural communities in general. Although the Esoko
communication platform has been deployed in over 10 countries worldwide,
most users are currently in Ghana, followed by Mexico.

In addition to MIS platform, Esoko has honed its data collection
technology Insyt, helping organizations collect information, biometric
and spatial, from hard to reach areas.

The organization plans to scale up across many more countries across
Africa to serve even more rural populations. They plan to do this by
partnering with government and private stakeholders, and they plan to
sustain the project by connecting service providers with the database of
biometrics and other data they collect from their users.

Currently, the organization hosts 2.5 million user profiles across
Ghana, Tanzania and Mexico. Of those, Esoko has about 700,000 users'
biometric profiles. They also offer GIS mapping, where more than 104
acres of farms have been mapped as of early 2018.

Challenges
==========

**Low levels of traditional literacy ­--** Getting someone to identify a
text message is difficult among the target populations that Esoko works
with. There are variable levels of literacy between sites and
communities, so the project has to be adaptable to different user needs
and levels.

**Lack of telecommunications infrastructure --** Esoko targets rural
areas that are hard to reach in person and hard to support
technologically. Sending messages to rural areas is sometimes difficult
because of the limited ICT infrastructure. To work around this, they
developed apps that can work offline and can sync later when
connectivity is available.

**Social norms --** The transition to mobile banking is difficult for
those who are used to paper money. It seems too abstract, and there is
resistance to using tech to replace previous transaction styles.

Esoko's Suggestions for Future Projects
=======================================

**Government support may be necessary for building supplemental
infrastructure --** Some developments can only be achieved with
government support and resources. Technology projects can devise
work-arounds to make do with limited infrastructural support, but
ultimately broad scale national development is advantageous.

**Investing in enhancing the basic as well as digital literacy levels of
target populations may be essential for the growth of information-based
tools such as Esoko ­--** There is a need for more support for digital
literacy in general, but also for basic literacy and for systems to
sustain farmers' knowledge acquisition and transfer.
