Executive Summary 
==================

Since 2006, WLAN Slovenija has built a community wireless network to
provide open and free access to the Internet across Slovenia. As of
2017, more than 400 wireless nodes are active with more than 2 million
non-unique usages. Originally started in the region around the capital,
Ljubljana, WLAN Slovenija now extends beyond the country's borders and
into Croatia and Austria. Costs are low because the system relies on
common technologies already in use, though there has also been private
support. Users join on a voluntary basis and each individually adds
value to the overall network by increasing its reach. WLAN Slovenija is
an example of building a community wireless network that is a symbiosis
of accessibility needs and a shared interest in propagating the network
that has the potential to be hindered by uneven retention, unfriendly or
indifferent governmental/legal restrictions, and a too localized model.

Context
=======

Located in central Europe and a member of the European Union (EU),
Slovenia has a small population with a highly educated workforce.
Population centers are dispersed, and the general topography includes
many hills and mountains, which can make connectivity difficult.
According to 2011 data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), 77.6 percent of the population has Internet
access. Though the country has seen a lower Information and
Communications Technology Development Index (IDI) ranking in the
International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) *Measuring the Information
Society Report*, the government has been competitive in its efforts to
meet the EU 2020 mission for Internet infrastructure development. The
Slovenian government's own plan, Digital Slovenia 2020, aims to increase
this infrastructure as a stimulus for economic growth. Their target is
to provide broadband access speeds of at least 100 megabits per second
(Mbps) to 96 percent of households by 2020. Community-level efforts such
as WLAN Slovenija have helped overcome some developmental hurdles.

Project Description
===================

WLAN Slovenija is an open-source and free community wireless network
that has been active since 2009. WLAN Slovenija, like many other
community wireless networks, repurposes widely used technologies (e.g.,
commercially available routers), and capitalizes on fiber-optic Internet
capabilities of urban centers to make the network function. By finding
redundant capabilities within the existent networks (e.g., bandwidth
users are paying for but not using), WLAN Slovenija provides individuals
with reciprocal use ability. Users consent to allow for their bandwidth
to be shared, and then link to a larger antenna that broadcasts their
"unused" Internet. In this way, users are able use their own Internet at
home, have connectivity for guests, and "borrow" from another
participant in the network when they are mobile. Beginning with the
cities, WLAN Slovenija has moved into rural areas as well to meet
demand.

While the initial genesis of the network demanded expertise, WLAN
Slovenija has made the end-user process as frictionless as possible.
Originally there were do-it-yourself (DIY) instructions for interested
participants to repurpose their in-home modems; however, users asked for
already-made versions, and WLAN Slovenija provided these by mail. From
the outset, WLAN Slovenija has fostered a community that is linked by
its desire to see the whole country have access to network.

WLAN Slovenija has minimal overall costs, though they have received some
private and grant funding, and relies on voluntary participation and
expertise. Moreover, awareness of the project generally travels by word
of mouth

Progress and Results
====================

WLAN Slovenija has been considerably successful in its endeavor. Begun
in 2009 with 10 Wi-Fi hotspots, as of 2017, there are 400 active nodes
with more than 1,600 registered. While they do not track unique users,
as of 2017, there have been more than 2 million usages of the network.
Interest has grown organically through word of mouth as well, though
WLAN has received some outside funding and regularly participates in
Google's "Summer of Code."

Much of the outside support they have received has not been monetary, as
costs are minimal, but rather in expertise, server space, and hardware.
The low friction of joining the network provides an opening to teaching
individuals with non-technical skills how this type of technology
functions. In a similar vein, by reaching out to HAM radio operators,
WLAN Slovenija has created a space for intergenerational contact. WLAN
Slovenija, which was begun by individuals associated through an early
email mailing list, has from the outset focused on the community that
surrounds the network. To this end, they encourage the linking of sites
that house hacking, artist, and co-working spaces.

Since at least 2015, WLAN Slovenija has been deploying open-node access
points for refugees and migrants as well.

Challenges
==========

**Coordination and sustainability --** The primary challenge for WLAN
Slovenija early on was coordinating all of the volunteers on the
project. This can be problematic as certain aspects of the setup and
maintenance require expert knowledge, and individuals with these skills
often do not have the time to donate to the project nor can they always
be counted on to not start their own project. In view of sustainability,
retention of users can be a problem (e.g., when individuals change
residences). Finally, it can also be difficult to keep users interested
in the project thereby forfeiting some of the sense of community the
continued functioning of the network demands.

**Security and liability concerns --** Users unfamiliar with the way the
network functions can be resistant, citing security or liability
concerns.

**Nomenclature --** WLAN Slovenija has changed names multiple times
because they were not general enough when choosing a name. This can hurt
brand visibility.

WLAN Slovenija's Suggestions for Future Projects
================================================

**Community and branding is key --** Organic, word-of-mouth marketing is
important for sustainability, since the network needs a community who is
willing to maintain its continued existence and growth. One of the best
ways to grow the community is to make joining as frictionless as
possible. As important as creating a community is, sustaining it also
requires attention. This can take the form of wikis, chats, and other
networked iterations, both online and in person. In addition, the way in
which the project is sold to possible users is paramount to maintaining
the community. It is helpful to frame it as an act of "sharing" what is
paid for, but unused. Similarly, it can be pitched to technologically
un-savvy homeowners as useful for their guests. It is also important to
assuage their fears regarding security, privacy, and liability that can
be connoted by "open."

**Legality should be investigated in some jurisdictions before
deployment --** Projects such as WLAN Slovenija are not viable within
the legal frameworks of all jurisdictions; however, workarounds have
been shown to be possible (such as in Kyrgyzstan, where community
members developed a laser-based network since public Wi-Fi networks are
forbidden).

**Sustainable financing is necessary for continued survival of community
networks --** Reliance on voluntary labor leads to both sustainability
problems and a possible lack of individuals with the requisite skills
for maintenance and improvement on community wireless networks. This
also works to the detriment of the network's survival because it makes
it more difficult to receive financial support from governmental,
nonprofit, or other sources who donate to organizations.
