Executive Summary 
==================

Fusion is a special, nonprofit program of Sarvodaya, the largest NGO in
Sri Lanka. Fusion imparts an education program focused on information
and communication technologies (ICTs) aimed at rural communities since
2006. Fusion uses telecenters installed by Sarvodaya and facilitates
access to both entrepreneurial and educational opportunities. As of
2017, Fusion operates 80 telecenters across 22 of Sri Lanka's 25
districts. Through a partnership with local community centers, Fusion
manages to cut the travel costs of participants and attracts a large
ratio of women. By combining small-scale business opportunities with
structured ICT educational resources and classes, Fusion sustainably
supports technological literacy in rural Sri Lanka.

Context
=======

According to the Ministry of Finance and Planning, while Sri Lanka's
literacy rate is approximately 91 percent, the ICT literacy rate was
only 35 percent in 2012. Urban computer literacy was 25.1 percent, while
rural and estate areas were only 15.1 percent and 4.3 percent computer
literate, respectively. Low incomes, lack of corresponding literacy
programs in the schools with digital facilities, software incompatible
with local languages, as well as poor ICT infrastructure in certain
areas, are all reasons for low computer literacy rates. Women are
especially vulnerable to these barriers due to social stigma, safety
concerns, and poverty.

Multiple initiatives exist to improve Internet access and ICT skills for
Sri Lankans. At least 4,500 schools have been provided with ICT
infrastructure, where 22,500 teachers were trained for student-centered
ICT learning since 2006. The Information and Communication Technology
Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) implemented the Nenasala project to establish
knowledge centers in all parts of the country and provide ICT-based
services to the people, especially those in rural areas.

Project Description
===================

Rural telecenters in Sri Lanka have earned the majority of their income
by offering digital literacy training programs, since their
establishment in the late 1990s. Due to large disparities in the quality
and methods of these educational offerings, Fusion developed a
standardized curriculum, methodology, and completion certificate. Fusion
created an effective training course and materials with the help of
members of the ICT industry and a local university (the University of
Moratuwa). Fusion distributes this course around the country to
entrepreneurs running these centers to improve business practices,
provide employment opportunities, and improve the quality of ICT
education at a low cost. Additionally, the telecenters provide many
benefits to women in particular. Women make up 60 percent of students in
the courses, and 25 percent of the telecenter operators are women.

Each telecenter manager pays their own operating costs and contributes a
small portion of their profits to Fusion. The course costs between LKR
8,000 (US\$ 51.81) and LKR 13,000 (US\$ 84.19), and takes four-to-six
months to complete. This price includes in-class instruction as well as
a student guide/textbook, three exams, supplementary online seminars
created by university faculty, and an official certification.

Fusion operates a sustainable, social enterprise business model. By
collecting a percentage of each telecenter's revenues for its
educational courses and keeping its costs low by relying on
entrepreneurs for maintenance and marketing, Fusion is not reliant on
government funding and does not require continuous support from outside
donors.

Progress and Results
====================

As of 2017, Fusion operates 80 telecenters across 22 of Sri Lanka's 25
districts. Fusion has been recognized by the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTD), Microsoft, HSBC, and the World Bank
for their successes in empowering communities through information
technology (IT), building leaders, increasing youth employability,
bringing ICT education to marginalized children and youth, and bringing
technology to communities impacted by war.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding --** Fusion does not have a budget to assist
telecenters in updating their equipment. This poses challenges both to
expansion as well as keeping the centers updated in a standardized
fashion.

**Lack of locally relevant and local language content --** Education in
Sri Lanka is conducted in Sinhala, but the nature of ICT requires a
better than basic understanding of English. Training courses are given
in English in order to integrate and improve the trainees' necessary
English-language skills to use the course's software from Microsoft and
Cisco, and increase their chances for employability.

**Lack of skilled manpower** **--** The pace at which technology
transforms and requires updating can pose challenges to the program's
structure. Trainers need to be re-trained at least once a year -- and
sometimes more often than that when new programs are introduced to
course.

Fusion's Suggestions for Future Projects
========================================

**Local centers for ICT education are beneficial--** The benefits of
rural villages having access to high-quality training courses in their
local town centers are many. Privately operated courses in the city
charge higher tuition rates and have associated travel costs. In
addition, these local centers, with their proximity to well-known
community hubs such as temples, help attract a large ratio of women.
Local community centers are safer destinations for women to travel to
and more convenient.

**Building local relationships is necessary --** Fusion notes the
importance of laying the groundwork for the project among the community
members themselves. While not every telecenter successfully adopts the
program, the ones that do have strong relationships of trust with Fusion
-- whose administration works to ensure entrepreneurs understand the
level of support they can count on.

**Maintaining donor relations and communication is essential --** Fusion
is a small-scale social enterprise whose impact has been recognized by
large-scale organizations. There was a learning curve in managing the
way Fusion sustained successful communication patterns with their
supporters.
