Executive Summary  {#executive-summary .ListParagraph}
==================

Using a site-based hybrid technology approach that combines TV white
space (TVWS), fiber optic, and line-of-sight service, Unlimited Wireless
Internet from Picosoft provides fast, high-speed Internet service in
rural areas of Nepal where cable and asynchronous digital subscriber
line (ADSL) Internet are not available. Picosoft donates and installs
computer labs in public schools in rural Nepal and provides connectivity
to those schools and to government offices. The project is dedicated to
providing rural Nepal with an alternative that is faster and less
expensive than satellite Internet. The project currently serves a total
of 16,800 students across the 20 schools as well as 14 government
offices with more than 200 government officers. In association with the
Microsoft Innovation Center, they provide web development services,
digital literacy training, and e-governance services to the people of
Nepal.

Context {#context .ListParagraph}
=======

Over the course of a decade, Nepal witnessed a 17-fold growth in the
number of Internet users: from only 1.1 percent of the total population
in 2006, to 17.2 percent in 2016. This constitutes the addition of
approximately 4.9 million Internet users, according to Internet Live
Stats. Together with the increasingly cheaper mobile phones, mobile
Internet use in Nepal has grown rapidly, accounting for the majority of
subscribers. However, Internet users and quality networks are
concentrated in the major cities of Nepal, leaving the rural areas with
scarce-to-nonexistent Internet connectivity.

According to a research by Nischal Regmi and Martin Chautari, Nepal's
2017 household Internet penetration was estimated to be around 7
percent. Public Internet is available at a limited number of cyber cafés
in cities and a few piloted free public Internet centers. In these
places, Internet quality was found to be substandard, such as the
Internet bandwidth subscriptions in the cyber cafés at Panauti were of
at most 512 kilobits per second (kbps) and were shared among eight-to-12
customers simultaneously. Meanwhile, even the richest quintile of the
population cannot afford the basic asynchronous digital subscriber line
(ADSL) service, Regmi and Chautari found.

Project Description {#project-description .ListParagraph}
===================

The project began by providing 148 computer labs to 148 public schools
in rural Nepal, starting four-to-five years ago. Each lab features 20
computers, two servers, and two uninterruptible power supplies. The
connectivity for those schools was so spotty that it spawned a second
initiative to enhance rural connectivity, started in June 2017 with the
support of a Microsoft grant. They currently serve 20 schools with
connectivity in Dhading district, three-to-four hours from the capital
city of Kathmandu. These schools are connected using hybrid technology,
which consists of a combination of fiber optics, line-of-sight, and/or
TV white space (TVWS) technologies depending on the geographic
conditions in the area. Line-of-sight connectivity is cheap because the
modems are only roughly US\$ 120 each, but difficult in most cases
because it depends on clear terrain. TVWS is more expensive, costing
between US\$ 6,000 and US\$ 9,000 to set up and maintain. Initially, the
project only used TVWS, but in cases where other modalities can serve
more advantageously, they are being converted to less expensive options.

In order to assess connectivity options, Picosoft determines the Global
Positioning System (GPS) location of the schools in order to see if
there are line-of-sight capabilities or not. But this requires a lot of
deskwork and follow-up, since often the information is not entirely
accurate because there are other factors such as new buildings, or the
forest grew taller, thus line-of-sight has been interrupted. Finally,
the installation team goes to these sites to assess and install.

In addition to 20 schools, the project also serves 20 public Wi-Fi
hotspots with connectivity. Those 20 sites include four parks (selected
by the local government), 14 government offices, one municipality, and
one public library.

Service is provided free-of-charge to the schools for one year, and then
defaults to the government rate irrespective of school enrollments. For
the government offices, the cost is US\$ 30 per month for 2 megabits per
second (Mbps) service. They are in the process of improving the backhaul
bandwidth to provide faster service too.

Progress and Results {#progress-and-results .ListParagraph}
====================

The project currently serves a total of 16,800 students in grades 1-12
across the 20 schools. In addition, the project serves 14 government
offices, which includes more than 200 government officers, and the many
daily visitors to those offices who use connectivity services there. The
project is in the process of developing user analytics about site
popularity and other information, but statistics are not yet available.

The project is developing a number of awareness programs with the
government offices related to e-governance including registration of
vital information including birth, death, marriage, etc., as well as
health issues, public hygiene, and environmental awareness.

The project offers three levels of information and communications
technology (ICT) training, many of which are digital instructional
videos. The levels include digital literacy and basic computer skills,
digital citizenship and security, and how to use e-government services.
They have developed an online learning portal to support this training
initiative as well.

Picosoft also hasan in-person training component in which teachers are
trained to become ICT educators, and staff travel around rural villages
with a trunk of laptops in order to conduct instructional tutorials.
Every week the project conducts a one-week intensive training for
approximately 40-50 teachers who then become ICT educators.

Challenges {#challenges .ListParagraph}
==========

**Geographical barriers--** As it is situated in the Himalayas, the
terrain of Nepal is very mountainous, which makes it difficult for
trainers and users to get to the access sites. It also presents
technological challenges to providing Internet connectivity. Volatile
weather can knock antennas out of place and disrupt service as well.

**Transportation costs --** Due to the terrain and the lack of
infrastructure, it is difficult to get the necessary equipment to the
relevant locations. If something is missing or needs to be adjusted on
site, it takes a very long time to get additional materials to the
location.

**Scaling up --** Growing the project is very capital intensive, and
funding is difficult to secure. The project is only partially monetized,
which makes it possible to sustain at current levels, but still leaves
open the question of how to grow.

Picosoft's Suggestions for Future Projects {#picosofts-suggestions-for-future-projects .ListParagraph}
==========================================

**Time and money should be allotted for unanticipated contingencies --**
Up to one-third of the budget should be allotted for unanticipated
contingencies. Because of the challenging terrain and novelty of the
project, there are many unexpected problems and delays that must be
accounted for as much as possible.

**Scaling up is necessary to keep costs low --** The project needs to
scale sufficiently to grow to a larger network in order to keep user
costs low and project budgets sufficient.
