Executive Summary 
==================

The Education Foundation for an Open Society Romania (EOS Romania) is a
nonprofit nongovernmental organization (NGO) established in 1999. EOS
focuses on reducing the digital divide by providing training and
resources for those without knowledge of information and communications
technologies (ICTs) to develop professional and everyday competences,
with a three-year project focused on professionalizing caregivers for
elderly people. While the initiative accomplished its basic goals of
training care workers as well as providing legal framework and policy
recommendations for the European Commission (EC), it has not developed a
sustainable implementation. The project seeks to yield more robust,
longer-term support from the national government based on
recommendations from the European Union.

Context
=======

Romania's elderly population accounts for approximately 15.4 percent of
the total population of the country. Most individuals in this
age-category have severely limited knowledge of digital technologies and
the Internet. Over the years, the government has worked to increase
digital literacy among the elderly. In every district of Romania, for
instance, the government has enacted programming such as multiple-week
sessions hosted in community and schools for the elderly to receive
certifications in digital literacy. So far, the government has
constructed more than 700 test centers across Romania. As of 2017, more
than 200,000 Romanians have received basic ICT literacy certifications
from these centers. The government often partners with civil society
organizations to build a network of actors to engage with the elderly
and augment their technological abilities.

In addition to longer-term programs, short-term initiatives have also
been enacted. These projects, such as "Internet Week" and "Get Online
Week," promote digital literacy through events and seminars, and are
supported by nationwide marketing campaigns. Yet, despite these efforts,
only 41 percent of the elderly in Romania use the Internet, based on a
2016 report.

Project Description
===================

EOS' pilot program had two main objectives. First, it aimed to improve
the quality of life, autonomy and safety of elderly people (+65) through
the integration of ICT into their lives. Second, it aimed to improve and
diversify the mobility opportunities of care workers in the European
Union. On that end, they focused on developing methods to train care
workers by providing them with the necessary digital skills necessary
that would enable them to achieve these goals.

The 36-month pilot program enrolled 200 elderly people who received
regular in-home care as well as 200 care workers and 50 informal
caregivers. While 200 care workers participated in the program as part
of continuing professional development program, 50 informal caregivers
participated through an adult learning program. In addition, 25 trainers
participated in the Trainer Course to train the participants. The
program initially provided 3G- and 4G-capable tablets to all the
elderly, and half way through of the program they decided to provide
tablets to the care workers as well to incentivize their voluntary work.

EOS Romania's pilot project was carried out under the Competitiveness
and Innovation Framework Program - the information technology and
communication (ICT) policy support section, in partnership with 14 other
organizations from 7 European countries. The program received US\$ 3
million funding by the European Union and matched by US\$ 2 million in
contribution by other partners.

Progress and Results
====================

The project achieved its intended objectives: to develop an effective
ICT training program for elderly care, to develop a certification test
that proves competence, and to provide policy recommendations to the
European Union for dissemination to all 28 member states. The EU also
accepted and mandated the program's recommendation that ICT training be
compulsory for all elder care workers. Currently, national governments
are still in various stages of creating legal statutes to change
professional eldercare along these lines.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of incentives --** The program did not include resources to
incentivize participation. Careworkers in Romania are low-paid employees
and often have additional part-time jobs to make ends meet. Attendance
at the training sessions was unpaid extra work, and the required
certification exam was a mere formality without professional benefit.
For some, the free skills training was incentive enough, but for most,
additional financial support or motivation would have been welcome as
well as more helpful to the pilot program as it pursued its research
goals. The program eventually decided to allow the participating
careworkers to keep the provided tablets, which somewhat increased
participation in the training, but did not have as large an impact as
compensated participation would likely have.

**Unwieldy user interface --** The training platform developed by the
program was not designed with the novice user in mind. Many, including
administrative staff, complained that the portal was unnecessarily
complicated to navigate and not user-friendly.

**Internet speeds --** Romania has a low level of digital literacy and
Internet access relative to its fellow EU member states. The 3G- and
4G-capable tablets were/are necessary, as most elderly users did not
have Internet connections.

EOS Romania's Suggestions for Future Projects
=============================================

**Simplified platform design could maximize access --** Developing an
easier-to-navigate training platform could maximize access and learning
capabilities for caregivers new to ICT and Internet navigation.

**Government involvement is helpful--** The project leaders noted that
they regret not maintaining closer involvement with local government
officials. Since the aims of the project were to create EU policy
recommendations, the eventual realization of the policy will rest on
these government representatives. A closer, collaborative relationship
with those upon whom the responsibility of implementation will rest is
important to maximizing impact as well.

**Policy recommendations can help assist other similar programs --** The
pilot program was able to make ICT training compulsory for caregivers.
Providing policy recommendations where possible may also assist other
projects and programs.
