Executive Summary 
==================

Sarantaporo.gr is a non-profit organization that aims to revitalize
communities by providing Internet connectivity and technology education
in rural Greece. Officially established in 2013, the organization has
grown from connecting the mountain village of Sarantaporo to providing
high-speed Wi-Fi to residents, organizations, and visitors in 15
different villages in the area. With volunteer labor, a number of
grants, and a longstanding partnership with the University of Applied
Sciences of Thessaly, Sarantaporo.gr NPO works to help villagers
incorporate connectivity into their daily lives. The organization
endeavors to foster a community-oriented mindset in order to ensure the
sustainability of the initiative, and conceives the Internet as a
commons.

Context
=======

Located to the west of Mount Olympus, Sarantaporo is a mountainous,
sparsely populated village of 570 citizens. Sarantaporo is located
almost 40 miles from the nearest city, Larissa, and is almost 120 miles
southwest of the major Greek city of Thessaloniki. The primary vocations
in the village are agriculture and animal husbandry. The area's
remoteness has made it a market failure area; as a result,
telecommunications companies are unwilling to invest in infrastructure
with no potential for profitability. The local authorities also failed
to provide such services for their citizens.

Project Description
===================

In 2010, a small group of young people who had grown up in or belonged
to the village of Sarantaporo decided to help their village connect to
the Internet. They sought to improve the quality of life and social
cohesion among inhabitants of rural areas that suffered from increased
isolation due to economic crises and ongoing digitization in
metropolitan areas. With no experience in information technology (IT) or
telecommunications, they reached out to open-source connectivity
communities and applied to the local Greek Free/Open Source Software
Society grants for hardware. They received the grant and installed the
first mesh routers in their village, providing open local connectivity
for all for the first time.

Word spread, and the project expanded to 14 other villages in the
surrounding region. In addition to the founding team, a number of
volunteers with no connection to the villages joined the project out of
a sense of social reasonability and outreach. Through the participation
in the 7^th^ Research Framework Programme (FP7) European research
project, the group secured € 90,000 (US\$ 104,836.50) to solidify the
network in 2014, interconnected all the villages, and partnered with the
University of Applied Sciences of Thessaly (60 kilometers away), which
provided Internet bandwidth pro bono to the community network as a
social responsibility toward the surrounding communities.

Today, the project maintains its operations with low overhead due to a
robust network of volunteers, financial donations from citizens and the
communities themselves, participation in research projects such as
CONFINE (a European FP7 project), grants from organizations such as The
People's Trust, and support from organizations like the Greek
Free/Open-Source Software Society. Sarantaporo.gr NPO effected a change
in their financial operations in 2015, when the difficulty of securing
the necessary community contributions to the equipment and maintenance
costs became unsustainable. The organization deputized "node owners,
adopters, and volunteers" as the main financial contributors to the
network. These villagers, who have volunteered to host the equipment
necessary for the village to enjoy free local connectivity, donate an
annual subscription fee to Sarantaporo.gr NPO. These node owners are
responsible for soliciting financial contributions to the system from
their own community, which requires a certain level of community
organizing and future-oriented thinking. As of now, the project does not
have a sustainable business model but they are exploring how to involve
the community more to sustain the network.

Progress and Results
====================

Sarantaporo.gr NPO continues the endeavor to strengthen the 15
communities through Internet connectivity, and is looking to further
expand their network in the region. For the past three decades, the
villages have suffered from severe population decline due to young
people leaving for opportunities in Greek cities and abroad. With
Internet connectivity, children and grandchildren return to visit their
elderly relatives in the villages more often and for longer. In
addition, as residents learn to use online communication tools such as
Skype, they are able to stay in regular contact with family and friends
abroad.

By using Internet study tools and an online course, a female student
from Flambouro village excelled in the national university exam and
enrolled in medical school, a first for the region. This prestigious
achievement was more than just personal -- Sarantaporo.gr NPO stresses
the inspirational power of her success to other villagers who now feel
motivated to pursue their ambitions. Further, Farmers have used the
Internet to find direct markets for their crops in the region,
eliminating intermediaries in trade, bringing increased profits, and
selling at lower prices to consumers.

The Greek Ministry of Health has digitized its drug prescription system.
This means that before the villagers had access to the Internet, these
elderly residents needed either to pay a great deal of money
out-of-pocket, or travel 30 km or more to a city where they could get
their medicine prescribed. Though these villages receive visits from a
traveling doctor once-a-week, their medical care has been greatly
improved by the new ease of getting their prescriptions.

These villages are largely farmland and often employ migrant laborers
from neighboring countries, such as Albania and Bulgaria. Sarantaporo.gr
NPO reports improved quality of life for these foreign workers, who are
now able to stay in touch with their families and friends at home, where
before they were greatly isolated by language barriers and long workdays
in the fields. Other residents report greater quality of life due to
social media decreasing their sense of isolation.

Challenges
==========

**Remote administration --** None of the volunteers who run the
organization are residents of the villages they serve. While many live
in neighboring urban areas of the region, some of them live as far away
as Athens (450 km away). The age and background of the inhabitants of
these villages often requires face-to-face communication from the
organization, which cannot be provided as often as the organization
would like. They hope in the near future to be able to hire two
full-time administrators who will work in the region, be more available,
and better equipped to continuously serve the area's needs.

**Engaging elderly users --** The majority of the villagers are older
people. While they are increasingly learning to enjoy the opportunities
and benefits of Internet connectivity, they are generally not
tech-savvy.

**Sustaining community contributions** -- Sarantaporo.gr NPO reports
that they have problems with some villagers, even under the new
community financing model, refusing to contribute and then discouraging
others from "foolishly" giving their money away, thinking that the
project is well-funded enough to do without their money.

**Lack of quantifiable data --** Sarantaporo.gr NPO has strong anecdotal
evidence for the success of their program. They have not introduced any
initiatives to quantify their data, however; thus, they have somewhat
limited evidence to share about the strength of their initiative.

Sarantaporo.gr NPO's Suggestions for Future Projects
====================================================

**Commons-based approaches can work** -- Sarantaporo.gr NPO notes that
successful and sustainable networks are often the product of successful
and sustainable communities. Their mantra of sorts is: "There is no such
thing as free Internet." Even without charging residents for bandwidth,
they demonstrated the utility of garnering community interest in and
understanding of the way infrastructure and connectivity must be
maintained. Their experience suggests that local organizations looking
to find sustainable solutions to maintain their newly implemented
networks may want to focus on methods to incentivize active
participation in the program. Sarantaporo.gr NPO credits their
sustainability to their ethos of changing consumer mindsets into active
community-building mindsets.

**Visibility efforts to engage stakeholders help solicit support --**
Sarantaporo.gr NPO puts effort into the public documentation of their
progress and successes. They publicize widely on the Internet, and they
pursue strong relationships with well-chosen foundations and
institutions. They maintain an active web presence, and their YouTube
channel hosts an hour-long documentary on the program's success. These
public-oriented gestures help the organization sustain a high profile
and solicit financial contributions.

**Community network interventions can help bridge gaps in access when
other actors do not step up --** Community-based initiatives such as
this one are helpful in countries where governments digitize welfare
infrastructure (e.g., drug prescriptions) without assuring that all of
its citizens have access to the Internet. In areas where private
telecommunications companies have no profit incentive to provide
connectivity, outside intervention may be required. Without government
aid, community and nonprofit organizations can helpfully fill this gap,
though an appeal to government support in cases such as these is
justified.
