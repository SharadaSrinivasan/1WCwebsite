Executive Summary 
==================

The Eastland College of Technology (ECT) in Nairobi, Kenya, is host to
the Informal Sector Business Institute (ISBI), that offers a training
course in micro-entrepreneurship with emphasis on information and
communications technology (ICT) education. ECT was established in 2004
to develop educational programs for the formal sector, training
technicians to aid Kenyan industrialization. The micro-entrepreneurship
course aims to improve economic development and business practices and
alleviate poverty among small, informal business owners in Nairobi since
2004.

Context
=======

In Kenya, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are a crucial
part of the country's business environment. MSMEs account for more than
20 percent of adult employment and around 12 percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP). According to the 2016 MSME Basic Report by
the Bureau of Statistics of the Government of Kenya, the country has
1.56 million licensed and 5.85 million unlicensed MSMEs in total.
Nairobi itself has 268,100 licensed MSMEs, 83.8 percent of which are
micro enterprises, as well as around 782,500 unlicensed MSMEs.
Furthermore, both licensed and unlicensed micro establishments in
Nairobi employ a total of 1,848,400 people.

According to a 2009 study done by researchers at Daystar University in
Nairobi, many of the micro-entrepreneurs that run these organizations
lack a formal education, both in general business operations and
technological handling despite being home to many institutions.

ICT adoption by MSMEs and micro-entrepreneurs has shown benefits such as
lowering marketing costs and increasing customer communication, base,
and loyalty. Micro-entrepreneurs have limited knowledge about how to
successfully employ ICT equipment to their business' advantage,
according to the 2016 MSME report. When asked, 43.1 percent of
respondents said they do not need ICT equipment, 34.5 percent said ICT
equipment is not applicable to their business, and 14.3 percent said the
acquirement cost is too high for consideration. Only 49.5 percent of
MSMEs utilize mobile money platforms for customer payments and cash
receipts.

Project Description
===================

The micro-entrepreneur training course meets once a week for four hours
over the course of a month. The modules in the training course focus on
different areas of business -- marketing, accounting, management,
communication, and business ethics -- as well as ICT-specific training.
The course provides flexibility in schedules, and special attention to
those who fall behind in their training or lose track of the schedule or
their progress. Rather than an exam, each module concludes with students
demonstrating ways in which they are able to integrate their training
into their existing business practices. Upon completing the course, they
are given a certificate and resources, including ongoing mentorship and
access to a computer lab.

Progress and Results
====================

Since 2003, ISBI has trained more than 5,000 people in the
micro-entrepreneur program. Beginning in 2013, the program decreased its
enrollment to 100 students per year in order to accommodate an improved
and sustained mentorship program. Students have access to trainers and
mentors both during and after their course in order to help them
navigate issues of business management as well as ICT-related questions.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding --** Though the program has won significant
financial support from several major donors, they continue to be
concerned about their long-term future. They are aware of the potential
for donor fatigue, and are exploring alternative business plans to
support the continuance of their course at sufficiently low cost for its
students. Exit by a micro-loan partner also poses a challenge to the
continued running of the institute. The program's costs, which include
electricity, trainers' salaries, professional development, and
infrastructure, are fairly high. The tuition fees are low enough to
allow local micro-entrepreneurs to attend but not high enough to begin
to cover costs.

**Lack of access to devices --** The number of students who are
currently in the course and the growing numbers of those who have
completed it make computer lab access and scheduling increasingly
difficult. As students integrate ICTs into their business practices,
they also become more reliant on the equipment and software the
institute provides for their use.

ISBI's Suggestions for Future Projects
======================================

**ICTs aid micro-entrepreneurs immensely --** The project team emphasized
an ICT component in business management for micro-entrepreneurs. ICTs
provides access to tools and communities that promote better business
practices. Students are able to participate in knowledge-sharing
conversations with their peers via the Internet as well as keep in touch
with their trainers. Many students are more financially literate, and
have become adept at integrating online marketing and research into
their livelihood.

**Starting small can be useful --** The project team noted the
importance of starting small, with a robust and directly useful training
course for local business owners, the impact may likely market via word
of mouth. Having students act as ambassadors can be effective too.
