Executive Summary 
==================

Mucho Mangoes was founded in early 2015 to empower rural, smallholder
farmers to improve crop production and reduce waste and losses in the
mango farming industry in Kenya. Mucho Mangoes' methods include
providing a short message service (SMS)-based mobile platform to share
information and advice to farmers on what to do to prevent pests and
diseases as well as provide training on how to use their system. Mucho
Mangoes' business model depends on generating profits from sales of the
products that they empower farmers to produce. Their target is to reach
200,000 farmers by the end of 2020.

Context
=======

Agriculture plays a vital role in the livelihoods of Kenyans. Based on
statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the sector
contributes 26 percent of the country's total gross domestic product
(GDP), and another 27 percent through linkages with other sectors.
Moreover, it employs more than 40 percent of the total population, and
70 percent of rural citizens. Kenyan farmers do not have sufficient
access to the information that can help them improve crops and reduce
waste and losses after harvest, thus affecting their productivity and
income. In particular, the percentage of post-harvest loss of mango
fruit is about 45 percent in Kenya, compared to 40 percent in developing
countries. Small-scale farmers experience these losses due to limited
post-harvest skills and limited information on the impacts of climate
change.

There have been various ICT-based initiatives and projects by the
government and the business sector to provide information for farmers in
Kenya. One of these platforms is the Kenyan Farmer Website, which allows
farmers to research, connect with other farmers, and market their
products. In July 2017, there was a hackathon in Eldoret, Kenya, where
technology-savvy people from across Kenya gathered to present different
ideas on how to revolutionize the country's agriculture. In the same
month, Heifer International announced its partnership with Wefarm to
provide Kenyan farmers who do not have access to Internet with
agricultural information via free text messages. The government is also
running its Digital Literacy Program to improve the international
competitiveness of the Kenyan labor force as part of the Kenya Vision
2030 plan.

Project Description
===================

Mucho Mangoes' mobile education center provides training in both ICT
skills and agricultural production techniques. Using training materials
and the Internet, farmers learn techniques such as pre- and post-harvest
crop handling, pest and disease control, and crop husbandry. Through
this training, farmers also learn techniques to continue digitally based
agricultural education and use the Internet to connect to online
knowledge-sharing communities. The training, which consists of two-hour
daily sessions over the course of two months, is mobile for the purposes
of allowing farmers to both participate in the course and remain close
to their farms.

Progress and Results
====================

The program was initially geared toward mango farmers, but the interest
was so great that the training was opened to farmers of all ages,
backgrounds, and crop specializations. The only requirement for
enrollment is literacy. Most participants are women and young people,
and, additionally, a significant portion of participants is over 60
years old. Mucho Mangoes deliberately recruited a majority of women in
recognition of the fact that women in rural African communities are
excluded both from social spaces and online. While the program does not
have any tangible outcomes in terms of harvest production and loss until
the completion of a year, Mucho Mangoes is targeting 200,000 farmers by
the end of 2020.

Challenges
==========

**Insufficient staff --** Mucho Mangoes has found that demand for the
training they offer exceeds the amount of training they are able to
supply. This signals an untapped market and strong possibilities for
building a business, but also overwhelms the project in its initial
stages.

**Low levels of traditional literacy --** Participants enter the
training with varying degrees of digital literacy and experience.
Classes are offered throughout the day in order to provide scheduling
flexibility for working people but do not differentiate according to any
other metric. A mixed class means that students learning at different
levels are also learning at different paces. Older participants, for
example, tend to take longer to absorb the lessons of the programs and
often repeat classes or extend their participation in the training.

**Limited and irregular electricity access --** Irregular power supply
is a common problem in rural parts of the region. The project team is
exploring ways to integrate solar power options into mobile training
center construction and supply.

Mucho Mangoes' Suggestions for Future Projects
==============================================

**Mobile training to suit user needs can improve participation and reach
more farmers --** Mucho Mangoes' mobile training model provides maximum
possibility for participation. If the training facility were a fixed
location in a centralized location, most farmers would likely not be
able to access it due to limited time and money for travel. With a
flexible schedule, convenient location, and no fee, the mobile locations
are able to reach a wider range of farmers in the region.
