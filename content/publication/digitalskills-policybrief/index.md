# **Policy Brief: Digital Skills**

Digital skills have attained great importance, as more of the world goes online. We know little about what works to improve digital skills, despite a proliferation of initiatives imparting digital skills globally. This report analyzes the existing digital skills practices globally to identify trends that can potentially improve digital skills training and adoption. The report also references barriers to and drivers of digital skills training.

Our research represents amongst the most comprehensive catalogs of digital skills initiatives across the world, drawing from 339 digital skills initiatives globally and 44 case studies developed through in-depth interviews with project coordinators and secondary research.

The distribution of digital skills initiatives varies by continent. Most digital skills initiatives are focused on Africa and Asia, followed by Latin America, North America, Europe, and Oceania.

There is a heightened focus on certain marginalized populations in the case studies, while attention may be needed on areas such as accessibility and senior-focused digital skills initiatives. Most initiatives among our case studies target students (43%), females (26%), and out-of-school youth (13%); the least represented groups are seniors and the disabled.

We observe that digital skills trainings are geographically bound, with a predominant focus on rural initiatives within our case studies. Half of the digital skills programs are rural (50%), while a quarter of them are focused in urban areas (25%). Only a quarter of them focus on both rural and urban areas, suggesting that there may be substantial differences in the way these programs are designed for rural vs. urban areas. Our interviews also suggested that scaling initiatives is challenging, which may explain the stark focus on a specific geographic boundaries (either rural or urban) within the initiatives.

Although there are many initiatives to teach digital skills to various communities around the world, the report finds that the methodologies including the curriculum, practices, the durations, the devices are diverse.

Most initiatives still use computers (65%) to deploy digital skills training, despite the proliferation of mobile phones across the world as the predominant mode of Internet access. Of the initiatives we studied, only a few used mobile phones (21%) and tablets (14%).

A majority of the initiatives use in-person training (84%), with a very few that use online streaming (16%). Given the proliferation of COVID-19, this distribution may be detrimental to the delivery of digital skills training programs in remote-learning settings.

While the content of the training programs varies widely, basic ICT training and literacy (55%) dominates, followed by computer and software skills (16%), entrepreneurship and vocational training (12%), innovative education (10%). Our interviews suggest that the initiatives may be out of step with the adoption patterns of general populations. This focus on basic ICT training (often on computers) may not be useful within a remote-learning setting, as the population predominantly shifts to using mobile phones for several tasks. The second-highest focus of training programs in terms of providing skills for employment and jobs is encouraging.

We also found great variation in the duration of the programs, ranging from 2 hours to 100 hours, and from an academic semester to academic year. Only 2, however, allowed for a self-paced learning option. This may disadvantage people unable to make specific times for the training, often women and girls.

Most initiatives are medium to large in terms of scale, reaching over 10,000 people. A lot of these initiatives work in partnership with other institutions such as schools, libraries, or public telecenters with nearly 42% of our case studies partnering with over 100 institutions

Most case studies were digital skills programs are initiated by NGOs (57%), followed by private sector (20%). Government initiatives were comparatively sparse (16%). This also manifested in the economic models, as 65% of the case studies relied on grant-funding, having important implications for sustainability.

Given that the majority of the digital skills training programs we profiled are offered free of charge, lack of sustained funding (13%) is the biggest challenge for the sustainability of these programs, followed by limited and irregular electricity access (9%) to maintain the programs, lack of skilled manpower (8%), lack of access to devices (7%), resistance from the community (6%), coordination challenges between local organizations and funding agencies (6%), lack of Internet access (6%), and lack of locally relevant content (6%).

The report also highlighted that we lack the evidence on what combination of digital skills methods make the most impact on these communities. Most of the initiatives measure impact through qualitative methods, with every few quantifiable impact metrics that permit cross-regional and cross-country comparisons.

_1 World Connected_ is a research project of the Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition at the University of Pennsylvania. The project seeks to provide detailed, contextualized data through case studies of grassroots projects around the world. We have compiled a first-of-its-kind database spanning more than 1000 such initiatives from more than 50 countries, and compiled, through semi-structured interviews, 120 case studies on both demand- and supply-side efforts. Demand-side efforts are designed to encourage adoption and use. Supply-side efforts aim to extend Internet coverage.

The project is significant in two ways. First, it provides a grassroots-level understanding of what works and what does not in different contexts. Second, it aggregates lessons from numerous community-level initiatives all over the world and analyses emerging trends.

The goals of the project are three-fold:

1. To provide meaningful, systematically compiled and analyzed data on grassroots project with diverse funding sources, stakeholder groups and technologies across the world;
2. to bring together a community of project owners, investors, government actors, and more to communicate about projects;
3. to analyze policy levers that matter to improve the success of the future initiatives.
