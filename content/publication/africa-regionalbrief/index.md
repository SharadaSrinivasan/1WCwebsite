**Regional Brief: Africa**

Africa – home to 1.04 billion people – remains the least connected to the Internet among all regions in the world today. Only 23.4 percent of households are Internet users, compared to 59 percent in Asia, and 85.4 percent in continental Europe
# 1
. Internet usage rates range from more than 60 per cent in the region&#39;s more developed countries, to less than 10 per cent in the region&#39;s least developed countries
# 2
. Bridging the digital divide in Africa is thus a key priority, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic – digital infrastructure can provide businesses, governments, and people a critical lifeline, and build the foundations of a resilient and robust economic recovery.

This regional brief provides a snapshot of projects seeking to improve broadband adoption in the Africa region. Based on our projects database containing 1090 projects in 152 countries and 119 in-depth case studies from 50 countries, the regional brief provides key insight into the regional distribution of the such initiatives, who deploys them, their funding sources, and their business models. Summary statistics of the overall database and case studies are provided in Table 1.

Our data suggest an increased focus on innovative connectivity approaches in Africa compared to other regions. As noted above, Africa has the most initiatives in the overall database as well as among profiled case studies.

Initiatives addressing demand-side challenges – such as the lack of digital skills, local content – are predominant in both the overall database and in our case studies. The statistics for demand-side initiatives from Africa are slightly higher – both as a share of the overall database (66 percent) and of profiled case studies (70 percent) – compared to the total (58 percent of all initiatives; 58 percent of profiled case studies)

The greatest number of initiatives are run by non-governmental organizations, followed by the private sector, in both the overall database and among case studies, in Africa and globally. The share of African initiatives run by civil society organizations is slightly higher than the global distribution – 70 percent of all initiatives are run by civil society organizations, compared to 58 percent globally.

Initiatives focused on education – both in school and out-of-school – were the highest share of initiatives both in the overall database, and among profiled case studies. The statistics for Africa as a share of the overall total were similar in both the overall database and among profiled cases (30 percent in both). Interestingly, within the overall database, Africa had a larger share of community networks compared to commercial deployments (12 percent) compared to commercial deployments (7 percent), and the share of both domains for Africa was lower than the corresponding global share. This suggests the presence of more community-led networks than commercial deployments in our overall database, both globally and in Africa, focused on last-mile connectivity. The share of commercial deployments and community networks within the profiled cases are slightly higher than the share in the overall database. The African case studies profile an equal number of commercial deployments and community networks (12 percent each).

The remainder of the analysis primarily focuses on the profiled case studies (119 in number)

**Regional distribution**

1 World Connected has analyzed 119 case studies (globally) and of these 50 were from Africa. Of the 50 African initiatives, 33% are in West Africa and 31% in East Africa. Southern Africa also

has a significant number (28%) of the profiled initiatives while Central Africa and North Africa only account for 4% each.

Among our profiled case studies, a few countries seem to have the highest concentration of initiatives. Our data show that countries with higher levels of penetration have more initiatives. The top five countries in Africa with concentration of initiatives are as follows: South Africa (11%), Kenya (11%), Nigeria (8%), Uganda (7%), and Tanzania (6%).

The country-based distribution is provided in Figure 1.

**Focus of Different Stakeholders**

Our data show that different stakeholder groups focus on different types of initiatives, among our profiled case studies. Civil society groups were most involved in activities focused on addressing demand-side challenges, both in Africa and among all other regions. However, the private sector, traditionally strong on addressing supply-side challenges, has fewer case studies in Africa, compared to those in other regions. There are few government-led initiatives amongst our case studies, both in Africa and overall, focused on last-mile connectivity. Finally, our data show that there are several volunteer-led community-driven initiatives on the supply side that are taking root across our case studies, although the proportion of the same in Africa remains comparably low. Table 2 summarises our case studies by stakeholder group and the type of initiative they focus on primarily (demand-side challenges, supply-side challenges, or both.

**Location and Scale**

Our data also suggest that most last-mile connectivity initiatives in our profiled case studies, both in Africa and globally, are at the national level. Africa has fewer regional supply-side initiatives than across all 119 cases, although region demand-side cases remain comparable. Africa also has the presence of several International NGOs implementing demand-side initiatives on digital skills; none on the supply-side though. The proportion of local initiatives focused on both supply-side and demand-side challenges profiled from Africa are comparable to their proportion in the overall database. Most supply-side initiatives in Africa only scale at local level, with very few regional level case studies.

**Economic Model**

In terms of the whether initiatives have revenue models, 44 percent of the demand-side initiatives in Africa had no revenue generating model, compared to 38.66 percent in the overall database. On the supply side, 12 percent of initiatives in Africa had a revenue model, compared to 25 percent in the overall database. Overall, while 25 initiatives of the 42 supply side case studies have a revenue model, over half of the 11 case studies do.

**The case studies from Africa are now divided by sector and presented in brief below. They are clustered by a primary domain, acknowledging that case studies can belong to more than one domain.**

1. _ **AGRICULTURE** _

**AFRICAN WOMEN POWER NETWORK: PROVIDING ICT-BASED TRAINING TO WOMEN FARMERS IN TARABA STATE, NIGERIA**

The African Women Power (AWP) Network was founded in 2012 to train, empower, and publicize the stories of African women entrepreneurs. The organization provides a platform for publicity and funding for women and youth entrepreneurs in Nigeria. AWP currently runs three major training programs that combine technology and business education. The first program conducts webinars for African entrepreneurs featuring African experts. The second program provides education in developing business plans and pitch training opportunities to Nigerian students between the ages of 12 and 16. The third program trains women farmers in northern Nigeria, and connects them to improved agricultural methods and materials.

**ESOKO: PROVIDING ACCESS TO AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION THROUGH ICTs ACROSS AFRICA**

Esoko launched in 2005 and seeks to capitalize on increased mobile phone uptake across Africa to use information and communications technologies (ICTs) to help farmers improve their incomes. They started by sending voice and text messages to small farmers containing information on agribusiness, including weather and pricing, and linking farmers to buyers. They are now expanding the project to establish digital footprints within rural communities throughout Africa. They collect data from these communities (biometrics, GPS, and mobile money data) to form a database that can be used in a targeted way to connect users to specific services of interest (e.g., healthcare, business, e-governance, e-commerce, etc.). The project serves small farmers and rural communities in Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania.

**FARMERLINE: PROVIDING ACCESS TO INFORMATION OF FARMERS THROUGH VOICE MESSAGES IN GHANA**

Farmerline is a private company that offers technology-driven solutions to small-scale farmers. With offices in Ghana, Switzerland, and the United States, Farmerline provides affordable services to farmers seeking information on how to better access markets and prices, efficacious cultivation practices, sustainable growth, and increased productivity. In Ghana, where half the population depends on agricultural production for their livelihood and many struggle, Farmerline sells affordable mobile technology aimed at improving those livelihoods into profitable and sustainable practices.

**FARM RADIO INTERNATIONAL: USING ICTs TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR FARMERS IN ETHIOPIA**

Farm Radio International supports African broadcasters to provide radio services that share knowledge with and amplify the voices of small-scale farmers, their families, and their communities. It has been operational for 40 years. The organization helps African radio broadcasters meet the needs of local small-scale farmers and their families in rural communities through interactive radio programs. The organization currently works with more than 700 radio partners in 40 sub-Saharan African countries to fight poverty and food insecurity through providing high-quality resources for broadcasters, resources that help small-scale African farmers help themselves. The Canadian organization began operations in Ethiopia in 2012, and has offices in Malawi, Uganda, Ghana, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Mozambique. There are currently 36 impact projects running in seven countries, with over 40 national and international partners. Through its work with broadcasters and impact projects, FRI reaches tens of millions of small-scale farmers with agricultural information and opportunities to have a stronger voice in their own development.

**JAGUZA FARM TECHNOLOGY: PROVIDING FARMERS WITH LIVESTOCK INFORMATION VIA MULTI-MEDIA SOURCES IN UGANDA**

Founded in 2013, Jaguza uses information and communications technologies (ICTs) – such as its Livestock App – to facilitate the sharing of indigenous farming knowledge and enable poor farmers to obtain better prices for their products. In addition to printed how-to guides, Jaguza uses a variety of ICT tools, including websites, social media, blog posts, and Short Messaging Services (SMS), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), and mobile, offline, and online web applications. Jaguza&#39;s model allows farmers to easily pick up new farming methods that can diversify and improve their yields and production. Jaguza also helps rural farmers sell their livestock directly to growing urban and foreign markets. There are more than 30 ethnic groups in Uganda, each with its own indigenous farming methods, and Jaguza&#39;s model is designed to centralize and encourage farming knowledge transfer.

**MUCHO MANGOES: PROVIDING AN SMS-BASED MOBILE PLATFORM AND DIGITAL SKILLS TRAINING TO MANGO FARMERS IN KENYA**

Mucho Mangoes was founded in early 2015 to empower rural, smallholder farmers to improve crop production and reduce waste and losses in the mango farming industry in Kenya. Mucho Mangoes&#39; methods include providing a short message service (SMS)-based mobile platform to share information and advice to farmers on what to do to prevent pests and diseases as well as provide training on how to use their system. Mucho Mangoes&#39; business model depends on generating profits from sales of the products that they empower farmers to produce. Their target is to reach 200,000 farmers by the end of 2020.

**TAMEBERO: PROVIDING ACCESS TO INFORMATION FOR SMALL FARMERS AROUND THE WORLD**

Tambero is a web application launched in Colombia in 2012 that provides tailored information to farmers about how best to manage their livestock and crops. Farmers enter information about the type of food they are cultivating and the animals they raise; Tambero utilizes the entered data as well as information about the local environment to provide farmers with evidence-based recommendations about best farming practices in a language they can understand. For example, Tambero can advise farmers on what date they should stop milking cows in order to maximize yield during calving season. This knowledge is important to share, as many of the world&#39;s 570 million farms (of which 72% are less than 1 hectare in size) are not producing to their full potential, limiting the livelihoods of farmers and risking famine. Tambero now has over 200,000 registered users located in Benin, Colombia, Iraq, Mexico and Peru and other countries across the globe. The web application has a free version, which most of its users employ, but also &#39;premium&#39; and &#39;pro&#39; options. Tambero is currently exploring means of monetizing the web app via third-party advertisements and sales of much-needed agricultural goods.

1. _ **COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS &amp; COMMUNITY NETWORKS** _

**JAWUG PROJECT: DEPLOYING A COMMUNITY WIRELESS NETWORK IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA**

Johannesburg Wireless User Group began as hobby-turned-university project by four individuals in 2001. It had hundreds of participants at the height of its popularity, although its numbers have dwindled. JAWUG uses widely available standards-based radio frequency technology on a license-free frequency. It aims to create a community-owned wireless network. Free-to-use by non-members, JAWUG has a voluntary membership fee used to defray some of its operational costs. By 2017, JAWUG saw its user base dwindle to about 15 people, with a core group of eight who work to maintain the network&#39;s functioning. JAWUG is an example of a membership-model community wireless network sustained long-term by dedicated enthusiasts, but has seen membership decline as Internet access became more ubiquitous and cheaper from commercial providers.

**LI-FI (LIGHT FIDELITY) LED: USING LED LIGHT BULBS TO PRODUCE INTERNET IN RURAL AREAS IN IVORY COAST**

Li-Fi LED is a government-affiliated technology startup in the Ivory Coast that specializes in the intersection between Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) Internet technology and sustainable energy. Li-Fi technology provides high-speed Internet connectivity using everyday light bulbs and specialized receivers. Unlike Wi-Fi, which uses radio frequencies, Li-Fi relies on the visible light spectrum. Li-Fi LED has accomplished its short-term goals of providing connectivity and sustainable solar energy infrastructure to several difficult-to-reach border villages in the country, and seeks to achieve broader region-wide rollout in the long term.

**PAMOJA NET: PROVIDING INTERNET ACCESS THROUGH MESH WI-FI IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO**

Pamoja Net is a mesh-Wi-Fi network on the island of Idjwi in Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. Ensemble Pour La Difference, a not-for-profit organization has deployed the network in collaboration with Fjord, an innovation consultancy based in the United Kingdom. The network has provided Internet access to 10,000 Congolese people through a public display system and Wi-Fi access points since May 2016.

**PROJECT ISIZWE: PROVIDING PUBLIC WI-FI ACCESS IN SOUTH AFRICA**

Project Isizwe is a non-profit organization in South Africa. Founded in 2013, it aims to connect low-income communities across South Africa to free, high-quality Wi-Fi networks at the lowest possible cost in public spaces. Project Isizwe seeks to promote education within these communities by providing Internet connectivity. Since its inception, Project Isizwe has connected around 3 million South Africans to free, public Wi-Fi, and provided access to information and opportunities. Through the project&#39;s efforts, individuals have obtained more than 200 jobs and benefited from 11,000 online digital literacy programs.

**SOWETO WIRELESS USER GROUP: CONNECTING LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES**

**THROUGH WIRELESS INTERNET IN SOUTH AFRICA**

Soweto Wireless User Group (SOWUG), is a nonprofit organization based in Johannesburg, South Africa. The organization seeks to erode the digital divide in Africa. They provide include digital literacy training and deploy wireless hotspots. As of 2017, more than 1,000 people, including 50 youth and 10 businesses, have received digital literacy training. The SOWUG has also deployed upwards of 20 free, public hotspots. SOWUG is an example of a solution for accessibility and ICT familiarity in underserviced communities that is constrained by funding.

**TUNAPANDA INSTITUTE: PROVIDING DIGITAL SKILLS FOR THE YOUTH IN KENYA**

The Tunapanda Institute is a nonprofit organization founded in 2014. Located in the Kibera quarter of Nairobi, the institute offers free training programs for students between the ages of 18 to 25 in information and communications technologies (ICTs), design, and business. By providing residents of the city&#39;s largest slum with the skills and equipment to qualify for entry-level jobs in tech, Tunapanda aims to empower communities by shrinking the digital divide. It is currently developing a project to target even younger residents with ICT education and digital resources by building a community network to connect Kibera&#39;s 300 schools.

**VANU RWANDA: PROVIDING AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY IN RURAL RWANDA**

Vanu Rwanda deploys Compact Radio Access Network (CRAN) technology to provide GSM and Wi-Fi connectivity to hyper-rural communities in Rwanda. Vanu uses a unique wholesale network provider model, where Vanu&#39;s infrastructure can be used by existing Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to extend their service. As of 2017, they have built 31 solar- powered sites in various communities in Rwanda. Three of these sites provide free Wi-Fi using the supaBRCK technology, which works in areas without connectivity. Each supaBRCK has an advertisement-based service platform that provides zero-rated content after a short advertisement.

**VISION NET: PROVIDING HIGH SPEED INTERNET IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO**

VisionNet is an Africa-based organization that offers a large range of high-speed wireless Internet services to customers in Bunia and Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). They also offer satellite Internet access across the DRC. Launched in 2015, Pocket Cyber Café is a service that aims to provide low-cost Internet connectivity via Wi-Fi hotspots at rural universities in the DRC. The target audience is the student population on campus in rural areas, but the service also extends to private access points for small business owners, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and others in need of service. Each university has customer-provided equipment (CPE) that receives broadcasts from a central signal from the main transmitter, and transmitted to numerous hotspots across campuses.
