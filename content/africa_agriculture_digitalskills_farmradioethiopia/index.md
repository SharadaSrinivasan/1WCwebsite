Executive Summary 
==================

Farm Radio International supports African broadcasters to provide radio
services that share knowledge with and amplify the voices of small-scale
farmers, their families, and their communities. It has been operational
for 40 years. The organization helps African radio broadcasters meet the
needs of local small-scale farmers and their families in rural
communities through interactive radio programs. The organization
currently works with more than 700 radio partners in 40 sub-Saharan
African countries to fight poverty and food insecurity through providing
high-quality resources for broadcasters, resources that help small-scale
African farmers help themselves. The Canadian organization began
operations in Ethiopia in 2012, and has offices in Malawi, Uganda,
Ghana, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Mozambique. There are currently 36 impact
projects running in seven countries, with over 40 national and
international partners. Through its work with broadcasters and impact
projects, FRI reaches tens of millions of small-scale farmers with
agricultural information and opportunities to have a stronger voice in
their own development.

Context
=======

Ethiopia's main economic sector is agriculture, accounting for 37.2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016, according to the World
Bank. Agriculture is envisioned in the country's second Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP II) as one of the major factors leading the
growth of the economy, and helping Ethiopia become a middle-income
country by 2025, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO).

According to FAO, about 12 million smallholder farming households
account for approximately 95 percent of agricultural production and 85
percent of all employment in Ethiopia. Traditionally, these farmers,
especially those in rural areas, had very limited access to news and
updated agricultural information. Today, an increasing number of farmers
have access to mobile phones and radio sets, which brings them useful
information to increase yields and improve market efficiency.

Despite being one of the countries with the lowest ICT penetration in
Africa, Ethiopia had more than 25 million mobile subscribers in 2013,
according to analyst group TradingEconomics -- a number that is growing
especially rapidly in rural areas. Since 2014, more than 3 million
farmers have used their mobile phones to access the hotline service
provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ethiopian Institute of
Agricultural Research, and Ethio Telecom for agriculture information and
to increase productivity.

Project Description
===================

Farm Radio International was founded after a Canadian journalist
traveling in Zambia spoke with local broadcasters about how to ensure
the content of their radio shows was relevant to listeners' needs and
demands. On returning to Canada, he sourced and distributed radio
scripts containing agricultural information to radio broadcasters for
shows around Africa and in other continents. In addition to distributing
scripts and other resources, FRI now has various approaches to reach
farmers around Africa through on-the-ground communication for
development projects.

Now that mobile phones are much more widespread, FRI uses tools such as
interactive voice response (IVR) and SMS to reach out to and hear from
listeners on a regular basis. FRI also uses radio to poll listeners and
collect data for organizations and communities. This interactivity
enables listeners and communities to shape future radio programing and
content. Users in the targeted project areas are rural farmers who
listen to radio.

ICT Delivery and Development consists of three main work packages. The
first is an interactive voice response platform. Uliza (Swahili for
"ask") is a feedback-collecting mechanism. They conduct baseline
research before they launch a project to act as a reference point for
future research. The organization uses Mobenzi to conduct impact
assessments which measure changes in the knowledge, attitudes, and
practices of listeners to radio programs on targeted issues. Sampling is
based on household and geographic information; they then randomize the
farmers by zones and districts.

Farm Radio offers broadcaster resources, including radio scripts,
backgrounder information documents, a weekly electronic news service,
and a special online community called Barza, and share them with
thousands of African broadcasters. They, in turn, use these resources to
research, produce, and present relevant and engaging programs for their
audience of tens of millions of farmers. These resources are aimed at
increasing food supplies and improving nutrition and health and
encourage the use of farming practices that are ecologically sound and
environmentally sustainable, are suitable for communication by radio,
are useful and transferable within the developing world, and are
appropriate for both female and male small-scale farmers.

Farm Radio's core work, begun in 1979, is focused on maintaining a
network of existing radio stations. FRI partners with existing radio
stations and distributes resources such as radio scripts and theme packs
on different topics to serve as reference material for the station's own
program development. FRI serves 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa
across a network of more than 700 radio stations. The other major aspect
of the program is impact programming. FRI works with partners --
industry donors, governments, ministries, nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), etc. -- to develop participatory radio programs on specific
topics which have a targeted and sustained impact on a particular
development issue.

FRI provides training services to broadcasters who create programs for
small-scale farmers. They focus on direct, in-station training using
talented African broadcasters as trainers. Each trainer must complete an
intense workshop on training methodologies and creating effective
farmer-focused radio programing. Broadcasters who participate in the
in-station courses can take advantage of long-term, distance mentoring
from other professional broadcasters in Canada and across Africa. FRI
also creates innovative distance education courses delivered over the
Internet that can be completed online. Moreover, the organization
designs and conducts custom workshops on specific topics to help
broadcasters make the best possible farm radio programing. All of the
training is designed to meet the real needs of African farm
broadcasters. FRI gives radio stations and their staff tools to measure
the quality of their farm radio services, and identify what must be done
to improve them.

Progress and Results
====================

Farm Radio has more than 700 radio partners, and projects in 9 different
countries. One project of interest is in Ethiopia. Through more than 50
outcome evaluation surveys of African farmers in targeted intervention
areas across Africa, FRI has found that interactive farm radio programs
are regularly listened to by 40 percent to 60 percent of potential
listeners, and lead to an average of 20 percent of listeners applying
new, more productive practices on their farms.

FRI has estimated that, across eight large multi-country projects, the
cost saving is about US\$ 0.75 for each farmer who applies a better
practice on their farms as a result of listening to a FRI-supported
educational radio series.

From one of the impact evaluations conducted on an FRI project, farmers
also demonstrate increased knowledge of recommended agriculture
practices as a result of listening to programs created as part of Farm
Radio International impact projects, with approximately 96 percent of
some radio listeners scoring 60 percent or more on a follow-up knowledge
quiz about the promoted farm practices.

FRI has also designed programs specifically for women through the Her
Voice On Air approach. This approach that leverages the idea of
community listening groups, equips them with mobile phones, and assigns
each group one day of the week to produce a story of their own for
broadcast. This produces demonstrable change in attitudes in those
communities with regard to gender equality.

Challenges
==========

**Lack of sustained funding --** Some projects can generate revenue
through advertising, while the community of listeners can sustain other
projects (where farmers pool their resources), but budgetary constraints
continue to be a concern where communication for development tends to
not be a priority of funding agencies.

**Lack of Internet access --** The goal is to reach rural farmers, but
the rural areas are precisely the areas most underserved by Internet
service providers (ISPs) and infrastructure.

Farm Radio's Suggestions for Future Projects
============================================

**Multi-stakeholder approaches are helpful --** Top-down approaches do
not work in all cases. Complex agricultural issues often require
sustained cooperation between many different stakeholders, regulating
bodies, and fields of expertise over time. A multi-stakeholder approach
serves to convene farmers, government ministries, scientists, and
others.

**Active community participation is necessary to ensure sustainability**
-- FRI uses accessible, low or no-cost media like mobile calls in voice
menu surveys. The organization designs programs with stakeholders in
mind, and designs a space to facilitate farmer participation in the
program and in the development of future programing. According to an
AFRRI's study (link), farmers engaged in the design and development of
farm radio programing were almost 50 percent more likely to take up
agricultural practices deemed to improve their food security than
passive listeners. Those in communities that could hear the radio
programs were 10 times more likely to adopt the practice than those
farmers who had no access to the farm radio programs.

**Timing of the program --** Prime time ranges from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00
p.m., but prime listening times vary between men and women due to the
gendered division of labor and differential rhythms of the work day.
Programs that want to promote gender equity need to be broadcast across
the appropriate times of the day to capture the whole public. Similarly,
programs can be targeted to a core audience by broadcasting during
particular demographic peak listening times.

**New business models need to be experimented with in order to ensure
sustainability --** Funding is generated largely through advertising and
project funding. Sustainability methods can be evaluated through the
adoption of willingness to pay models as well as by proving the value of
the program to the community such that they are willing to take on
responsibility for sustaining the program. This can occur in several
ways, including through advertising or resource pooling by farmers.
